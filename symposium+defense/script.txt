Good afternoon everyone. I'm from the Medical Physics Group, and I'll be giving this talk in English. Our group is conducting research on the knee using both static and dynamic MRI. For this talk, I want to particularly focus on one algorithm we developed to automate the segmentation of tibia and femur from MRI cine images. 

Before diving into the algorithm, 
Let's start with why this research matters. Knee problems are a major health issue, affecting a significant portion of our population, especially as we age. Diseases that affect the knee like osteoarthritis can affect the way our knee moves, or alters the knee kinematics. But interestingly, changes in movement patterns might actually accelerate the progression of these conditions  We're looking at a vicious circle here. This isn't just true for OA; even in patients with ACL problems, it was found that their knee kinematics were altered, despite not showing obvious symptoms. That's why understanding tibiofemoral kinematics is crucial - it's key to breaking this cycle and improving knee health and function

Now, let's take a closer look at what we mean by tibiofemoral kinematics. 'Tibia' refers to your shin bone, while 'femur' is your thigh bone. Tibiofemoral kinematics simply means how the tibia moves relative to the femur. As you can see from the slide, this movement is quite complex. The knee joint actually has six degrees of freedom - that's six different ways the bones can move relative to each other. These are divided into three rotations and three translations. This complexity is why accurately measuring and understanding knee motion is both challenging and essential


To capture the complex motion of the knee, we use this custom MRI-safe device. It was designed and built in collaboration with our project partners at the Julius Wolff Institute in Berlin. Let me walk you through how it works:
First, the subject is positioned in the MRI scanner with their leg secured in this device. During the scan, they perform active knee flexion-extension cycles, guided by the steady beat of a metronome. This ensures consistent, repeatable motion.
Now, here's the clever part: The device is equipped with an optical sensor that precisely measures the knee's rotation angle in real time. This motion data is then synchronized with the MRI data we're collecting.
The result? We can retrospectively reconstruct a series of CINE frames, where each frame shows the knee at a specific angle in its flexion-extension cycle. It's like creating a smooth, detailed movie of the knee's motion inside the MRI.

Here are some reconstructed frames from our dynamic MRI sequence, showing the knee at different stages of flexion and extension. The basic idea of our segmentation pipeline is straightforward: we identify and isolate the inner boundary of the cortical bone for both the tibia and femur in the first frame. Then, we establish reference points along these boundaries and compute the transformation that moves these points from one frame to the next. We repeat this process, frame by frame, until we have the transformations for the entire motion sequence. Once we have these transformations, any segment we draw on the first frame can be automatically transformed for all subsequent frames, effectively automating the segmentation process.


Let's look at the process in more detail. First, we use edge detection to identify bone boundaries. Then, we apply connected component labeling to isolate specific structural features. We extract reference points along the labeled edges and compute transformation matrices to track bone movement across frames.
This process allows us to automatically segment the tibia and femur throughout the motion cycle. 

To evaluate the performance of our semi-automated method, we wanted to compare it with the traditional approach. So, we also performed manual segmentation of the same datasets and computed the angles between the long axes of the bones for both methods. 


Let's look at our results. On the left, you see graphs from five different datasets, each showing how the angle between the tibia and femur changes over time during the flexion-extension cycle. The blue line represents our semi-automated method, while the orange line shows the manual segmentation results. On the right, we have an aggregation of these five datasets. Notice how the shaded area, which represents the standard deviation, is consistently larger for the manual segmentation. This suggests that our algorithm produces smoother and more consistent results across different datasets.
Now, let's move to the next slide. Here, we've taken the derivative of the graphs on the left, which gives us the rate of change of the angle with respect to time. Essentially, this shows the speed at which each subject was moving their knee. In these graphs, the inconsistency of the manual segmentation becomes even more apparent.


The implications of this work are significant. It's part of a larger study involving 20 healthy participants and 20 post-ACL reconstruction patients, with baseline and follow-up measurements. Our method allows for efficient extraction of kinematic parameters for cohort analysis. Moreover, while we've demonstrated this in 2D, there's potential for 3D application, which could provide even more comprehensive insights into knee kinematics.
Thank you for your attention. I'd be happy to answer any questions
