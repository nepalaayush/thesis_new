	{MR}‐based methods provide low risk, noninvasive assessment of joint kinematics; however, these methods often use static positions or require many identical cycles of movement. The study objective was to compare the 3D kinematic results approximated from a series of sequential static poses of the knee with the 3D kinematic results obtained from continuous dynamic movement of the knee. To accomplish this objective, we compared kinematic data from a validated static {MR} method to a fast static {MR} method, and compared kinematic data from both static methods to a newly developed dynamic {MR} method. Ten normal volunteers were imaged using the three kinematic methods (dynamic, static standard, and static fast). Results showed that the two sets of static results were in agreement, indicating that the sequences (standard and fast) may be used interchangeably. Dynamic kinematic results were significantly different from both static results in eight of 11 kinematic parameters: patellar flexion, patellar tilt, patellar proximal translation, patellar lateral translation, patellar anterior translation, tibial abduction, tibial internal rotation, and tibial anterior translation. Three‐dimensional {MR} kinematics measured from dynamic knee motion are often different from those measured in a static knee at several positions, indicating that dynamic‐based kinematics provides information that is not obtainable from static scans.

	To evaluate the relationship between mechanical loading, as indicated by the external knee adduction moment ({KAM}) during walking, and {BML} on {MRI} in people with medial knee osteoarthritis.
	
	
	Methods
	Measures were taken in 91 individuals with medial knee osteoarthritis. Logistic regression analyses were performed with the presence/absence of medial tibial or medial femoral {BML} as the outcome and either peak {KAM} or {KAM} impulse as the independent variable. Analyses were also adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, alignment and walking speed.
	
	
	Results
	In adjusted analyses, peak {KAM} was significantly related to medial tibial ({OR} 2.3; 95\%{CI} 1.07 to 4.7), but not medial femoral ({OR} 1.85; 95\%{CI} 0.93 to 3.7) {BML}. {KAM} impulse was significantly related to both medial tibial ({OR} 9.4; 95\%{CI} 1.53 to 57.2) and medial femoral ({OR} 14.4; 95\%{CI} 2.3 to 89.8) {BML}.

	Background
	Whether the medial meniscus morphology and movement occur under upright loading conditions in early knee osteoarthritis ({OA}) or medial meniscus posterior root tear ({MMPRT}) remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the medial and anteroposterior extrusion of the medial meniscus under unloaded and upright-loaded conditions in patients with early knee {OA}.
	
	
	Methods
	Twelve patients with early knee {OA} and 18 healthy adult volunteers participated in this study. Magnetic resonance imaging using special equipment was performed with the participants in the unloaded and upright-loaded conditions. Medial, anterior, and posterior extrusions of the medial meniscus against the tibial edge were evaluated and compared between the early knee {OA} and healthy adult control groups. Additionally, 12 patients in the early knee {OA} group were divided into 2 subgroups based on whether {MMPRT} was observed, and the extrusion of the medial meniscus was compared.
	
	
	Results
	The amount of medial extrusion of the medial meniscus in both the unloaded and upright-loaded conditions was significantly greater in the early knee {OA} group than in the control group (unloaded: 2.6 ± 1.0 mm vs 0.7 ± 0.5 mm; upright-loaded: 3.7 ± 0.9 mm vs 1.8 ± 0.8 mm). Similarly, the anterior and posterior extrusion of the medial meniscus in the upright-loaded condition was significantly larger in the early knee {OA} group (anterior: 4.6 ± 1.0 mm vs 3.7 ± 1.1 mm; posterior: -3.4 ± 1.1 mm vs -4.6 ± 1.6 mm). However, no difference was observed in meniscal extrusion between unloaded and upright-loaded conditions. The posterior extrusion of the medial meniscus in the upright-loaded condition was significantly greater in {MMPRT} cases than in non-{MMPRT} cases in the early knee {OA} group ({MMPRT}: -2.7 ± 1.1 mm; non-{MMPRT} -4.1 ± 1.5 mm).
	
	
	Conclusions
	In early knee {OA}, significantly large meniscal extrusions of the medial meniscus in both unloaded and upright-loaded conditions were found compared with healthy adults. Among patients with early knee {OA}, those with {MMPRT} showed a large posterior extrusion of the medial meniscus in the upright-loaded condition compared with those without {MMPRT}.

Dynamic {MRI} ({DMRI}) represents an emerging technology that makes it possible to investigate the functional interaction among all the joint tissues without risks for the patient. However, traditional {MRI} scanners normally offer a reduced space of motion, and complex apparatus are needed to load the articulation, due to the horizontal orientation of the scanning bed. In this study, we present an experimental and computational procedure that combines an open, weight-bearing {MRI} scanner with an original registration algorithm to reconstruct the three-dimensional kinematics of the knee from {DMRI}, thus allowing the investigation of knee deep-flexion under physiological loads in space. To improve the accuracy of the procedure, an {MR}-compatible rig has been developed to guide the knee flexion of the patient. We tested the procedure on three volunteers. The overall rotational and positional accuracy achieved are 1.8° ± 1.4 and 1.2 mm ± 0.8, respectively, and they are sufficient for the characterization of the joint behavior under load.},

	To describe and evaluate a new segmentation method using deep convolutional neural network ({CNN}), 3D fully connected conditional random field ({CRF}), and 3D simplex deformable modeling to improve the efficiency and accuracy of knee joint tissue segmentation.
	
	
	Methods
	A segmentation pipeline was built by combining a semantic segmentation {CNN}, 3D fully connected {CRF}, and 3D simplex deformable modeling. A convolutional encoder‐decoder network was designed as the core of the segmentation method to perform high resolution pixel‐wise multi‐class tissue classification for 12 different joint structures. The 3D fully connected {CRF} was applied to regularize contextual relationship among voxels within the same tissue class and between different classes. The 3D simplex deformable modeling refined the output from 3D {CRF} to preserve the overall shape and maintain a desirable smooth surface for joint structures. The method was evaluated on 3D fast spin‐echo (3D‐{FSE}) {MR} image data sets. Quantitative morphological metrics were used to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the method in comparison to the ground truth data.
	
	
	Results
	The proposed segmentation method provided good performance for segmenting all knee joint structures. There were 4 tissue types with high mean Dice coefficient above 0.9 including the femur, tibia, muscle, and other non‐specified tissues. There were 7 tissue types with mean Dice coefficient between 0.8 and 0.9 including the femoral cartilage, tibial cartilage, patella, patellar cartilage, meniscus, quadriceps and patellar tendon, and infrapatellar fat pad. There was 1 tissue type with mean Dice coefficient between 0.7 and 0.8 for joint effusion and Baker's cyst. Most musculoskeletal tissues had a mean value of average symmetric surface distance below 1 mm.

	The combined {CNN}, 3D fully connected {CRF}, and 3D deformable modeling approach was well‐suited for performing rapid and accurate comprehensive tissue segmentation of the knee joint. The deep learning‐based segmentation method has promising potential applications in musculoskeletal imaging.},

Reproducibility of knee motion was investigated. Real-time and {CINE} mode anatomical images were reconstructed for different knee flexion angles by synchronizing the encoder information with the {MRI} data, and performing flexion angle selective gating across multiple motion cycles. When investigating the influence of the rotation angle window width on recon­ structed {CINE} images, it was found that angle windows between 0.5◦ and 3◦ exhibited acceptable image sharpness without suffering from significant motion-induced blurring. Furthermore, due to flexible retrospective image reconstruction afforded by the radial golden-angle imaging, the number of motion cycles included in the reconstruction could be retrospectively reduced to investigate the corresponding influence of acquisition time on image quality. Finally, motion reproducibility between motion cycles and accuracy of the flexion angle selective gating were sufficient to acquire whole-knee 3D dynamic imaging with a retrospectively gated 3D cone {UTE} sequence.},

	abstract = {Introduction: This work aimed to develop a novel multipurpose device for guided knee ﬂexion-extension, both passively using a motorized pneumatic system and actively (muscle-driven) with the joint unloaded or loaded during dynamic MRI. Secondary objectives were to characterize the participant experience during device use, and present preliminary dynamic MRI data to demonstrate the different device capabilities. Material and methods: Self-reported outcomes were used to characterize the pain, physical exertion and discomfort levels experienced by 10 healthy male participants during four different active knee motion and loading protocols using the novel device. Knee angular data were recorded during the protocols to determine the maximum knee range of motion achievable. Dynamic MRI was acquired for three healthy volunteers during passive, unloaded knee motion using 2D Cartesian TSE, 2D radial GRE and 3D UTE sequences; and during active, unloaded and loaded knee motion using 2D radial GRE imaging. Because of the different MRI sequences used, spatial resolution was inherently lower for active knee motion than for passive motion acquisitions.
Results: Depending on the protocol, some participants reported slight pain, mild discomfort and varying levels of physical exertion. On average, participants achieved ∼40◦ of knee ﬂexion; loaded conditions can create knee moments up to 27 Nm. High quality imaging data were obtained during different motion and loading conditions. Dynamic 3D data allowed to retrospectively extract arbitrarily oriented slices.
Conclusion: A novel multipurpose device for guided, physiologically relevant knee motion and loading during dynamic MRI was developed. Device use was well tolerated and suitable for acquiring high quality images during different motion and loading conditions. Different bone positions between loaded and unloaded conditions were likely due to out-of-plane motion, particularly because image registration was not performed. Ultimately, this device could be used to advance our understanding of physiological and pathological joint mechanics.},

	abstract = {This large scale computer-assisted telephone survey was undertaken to explore the prevalence, severity, treatment and impact of chronic pain in 15 European countries and Israel. Screening interviews identiﬁed respondents aged P18 years with chronic pain for in-depth interviews. 19\% of 46,394 respondents willing to participate (refusal rate 46\%) had suﬀered pain for P6 months, had experienced pain in the last month and several times during the last week. Their pain intensity was P5 on a 10-point Numeric Rating Scale ({NRS}) (1 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable) during last episode of pain. In-depth interviews with 4839 respondents with chronic pain (about 300 per country) showed: 66\% had moderate pain ({NRS} = 5–7), 34\% had severe pain ({NRS} = 8–10), 46\% had constant pain, 54\% had intermittent pain. 59\% had suﬀered with pain for two to 15 years, 21\% had been diagnosed with depression because of their pain, 61\% were less able or unable to work outside the home, 19\% had lost their job and 13\% had changed jobs because of their pain. 60\% visited their doctor about their pain 2–9 times in the last six months. Only 2\% were currently treated by a pain management specialist. One-third of the chronic pain suﬀerers were currently not being treated. Two-thirds used nonmedication treatments, e.g,. massage (30\%), physical therapy (21\%), acupuncture (13\%). Almost half were taking non-prescription analgesics; Ôover the {counterÕ} ({OTC}) {NSAIDs} (55\%), paracetamol (43\%), weak opioids (13\%). Two-thirds were taking prescription medicines: {NSAIDs} (44\%), weak opioids (23\%), paracetamol (18\%), {COX}-2 inhibitors (1–36\%), and strong opioids (5\%). Forty percent had inadequate management of their pain. Interesting diﬀerences between countries were observed, possibly reﬂecting diﬀerences in cultural background and local traditions in managing chronic pain. Conclusions: Chronic pain of moderate to severe intensity occurs in 19\% of adult Europeans, seriously aﬀecting the quality of their social and working lives. Very few were managed by pain specialists and nearly half received inadequate pain management. Although diﬀerences were observed between the 16 countries, we have documented that chronic pain is a major health care problem in Europe that needs to be taken more seriously.},

	abstract = {Objective: Osteoarthritis of the knee (knee {OA}) is a serious joint disease leading to pain and reduced quality of life. Pharmacological treatments include anti-inﬂammatories, analgesics, intraarticular hyaluronic acid, and intraarticular corticosteroids while for severe knee {OA}, knee replacement is an option. This study examined the incidence, prevalence, patient characteristics, and uptake of medical and surgical treatments in knee {OA} patients in Germany. Design: A non-interventional, retrospective health claims data analysis with anonymized data from the {InGef} database was performed. Patients  18 years were analyzed cross-sectionally for each year 2015–2020. Newly diagnosed patients in 2015 were also longitudinally analyzed until end of 2020.
	Results: Annual knee {OA} prevalence increased from 7.07 \% in 2015 to 7.39 \% in 2020. Annual incidence proportions ranged from 1.71 \% in 2015 to 1.46 \% in 2020. Knee replacement was the most common surgery, with rising patient numbers (e.g., 7918 patients in 2015 and 8975 patients in 2019). Approximately 62 \% of patients newly diagnosed in 2015 received prescription pharmacological pain treatment during follow-up. Most (96.95 \%) received non-opioid analgesics, followed by weak opioids (8.14 \%) and strong opioids (3.00 \%) as ﬁrst-line treatment (combinations possible). Knee surgery was performed in 16.6 \% of patients during follow-up. Median time from ﬁrst diagnosis until surgery was 346 days for any knee surgery and 564 days for knee replacement.
	Conclusions: The number of patients with knee {OA} in Germany is steadily rising, along with an increasing number of surgical interventions, especially knee replacement. Time until ﬁrst surgery and knee replacement is relatively short, even for newly diagnosed patients.},

	abstract = {Background  The impact of activity-related joint loading on cartilage is not clear. Abnormal loading is considered to be a mechanical driver of osteoarthritis ({OA}), yet moderate amounts of physical activity and rehabilitation exercise can have positive effects on articular cartilage. Our aim was to investigate the immediate effects of joint loading activities on knee and hip cartilage in healthy adults, as assessed using magnetic resonance imaging. We also investigated delayed effects of activities on healthy cartilage and the effects of activities on cartilage in adults with, or at risk of, {OA}. We explored the association of sex, age and loading duration with cartilage changes.
	Methods  A systematic review of six databases identified studies assessing change in adult hip and knee cartilage using {MRI} within 48 h before and after application of a joint loading intervention/activity. Studies included adults with healthy cartilage or those with, or at risk of, {OA}. Joint loading activities included walking, hopping, cycling, weightbearing knee bends and simulated standing within the scanner. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Random-effects meta-analysis estimated the percentage change in compartment-specific cartilage thickness or volume and composition (T2 relaxation time) outcomes. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation ({GRADE}) system evaluated certainty of evidence.
	Results  Forty studies of 653 participants were included after screening 5159 retrieved studies. Knee cartilage thickness or volume decreased immediately following all loading activities investigating healthy adults; however, {GRADE} assessment indicated very low certainty evidence. Patellar cartilage thickness and volume reduced 5.0\% (95\% {CI} 3.5, 6.4, I2 = 89.3\%) after body weight knee bends, and tibial cartilage composition (T2 relaxation time) decreased 5.1\% (95\% {CI} 3.7, 6.5, I2 = 0.0\%) after simulated standing within the scanner. Hip cartilage data were insufficient for pooling. Secondary outcomes synthesised narratively suggest knee cartilage recovers within 30 min of walking and 90 min of 100 knee bends. We found contrasting effects of simulated standing and walking in adults with, or at risk of, {OA}. An increase of 10 knee bend repetitions was associated with 2\% greater reduction in patellar thickness or volume.
	Conclusion  There is very low certainty evidence that minimal knee cartilage thickness and volume and composition (T2 relaxation time) reductions (0–5\%) occur after weightbearing knee bends, simulated standing, walking, hopping/ jumping and cycling, and the impact of knee bends may be dose dependent. Our findings provide a framework of cartilage responses to loading in healthy adults which may have utility for clinicians when designing and prescribing rehabilitation programs and providing exercise advice.},

	abstract = {Subject motion during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been problematic since its introduction as a clinical imaging modality. While sensitivity to particle motion or blood flow can be used to provide useful image contrast, bulk motion presents a considerable problem in the majority of clinical applications. It is one of the most frequent sources of artifacts. Over 30 years of research have produced numerous methods to mitigate or correct for motion artifacts, but no single method can be applied in all imaging situations. Instead, a "toolbox" of methods exists, where each tool is suitable for some tasks, but not for others. This article reviews the origins of motion artifacts and presents current mitigation and correction methods. In some imaging situations, the currently available motion correction tools are highly effective; in other cases, appropriate tools still need to be developed. It seems likely that this multifaceted approach will be what eventually solves the motion sensitivity problem in MRI, rather than a single solution that is effective in all situations. This review places a strong emphasis on explaining the physics behind the occurrence of such artifacts, with the aim of aiding artifact detection and mitigation in particular clinical situations.},

	abstract = {Acceleration is an important consideration when imaging moving organs such as the heart. Not only does acceleration enable motion‐free scans but, more importantly, it lies at the heart of capturing the dynamics of cardiac motion. For over three decades, various ingenious approaches have been devised and implemented for rapid CINE MRI suitable for dynamic cardiac imaging. Virtually all techniques relied on acquiring less data to reduce acquisition times. Parallel imaging was among the first of these innovations, using multiple receiver coils and mathematical algorithms for reconstruction; acceleration factors of 2 to 3 were readily achieved in clinical practice. However, in the context of imaging dynamic events, further decreases in scan time beyond those provided by parallel imaging were possible by exploiting temporal coherencies. This recognition ushered in the era of
	k‐t
	accelerated MRI, which utilized predominantly statistical methods for image reconstruction from highly undersampled
	k
	‐space. Despite the successes of
	k‐t
	acceleration methods, however, the accuracy of reconstruction was not always guaranteed. To address this gap, MR physicists and mathematicians applied compressed sensing theory to ensure reconstruction accuracy. Reconstruction was, indeed, more robust, but it required optimizing regularization parameters and long reconstruction times. To solve the limitations of all previous methods, researchers have turned to artificial intelligence and deep neural networks for the better part of the past decade, with recent results showing rapid, robust reconstruction. This review provides a comprehensive overview of key developments in the history of CINE MRI acceleration, and offers a unique and intuitive explanation behind the techniques and underlying mathematics.Level of Evidence: 5Technical Efficacy Stage: 1},

The algorithm handles a wide variety of image representation schemes (rasters, run lengths, quadrees, bintrees, etc.). How to adapt the standard {UNION}-{FIND} algorithm to permit reuse of temporary labels is shown. This is done using a technique called
	age balancing
	, in which, when two labels are merged, the older label becomes the father of the younger label. This technique can be made to coexist with the more conventional rule of
	weight 
	balancing
	, in which the label with more descendants becomes the father of the label with fewer descendants. Various image scanning orders are examined and classified. It is also shown that when the algorithm is specialized to a pixel array scanned in raster order, the total processing time is linear in the number of pixels. The linear-time processing time follows from a special property of the {UNION}-{FIND} algorithm, which may be of independent interest. This property states that under certain restrictions on the input, {UNION}-{FIND} runs in time linear in the number of {FIND} and {UNION} operations. Under these restrictions, linear-time performance can be achieved without resorting to the more complicated  Gabow-Tarjan algorithm for disjoint set union.},

	abstract = {Abstract
	The reconstruction of artifact‐free images from radially encoded {MRI} acquisitions poses a difficult task for undersampled data sets, that is for a much lower number of spokes in k‐space than data samples per spoke. Here, we developed an iterative reconstruction method for undersampled radial {MRI} which (i) is based on a nonlinear optimization, (ii) allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge with use of penalty functions, and (iii) deals with data from multiple coils. The procedure arises as a two‐step mechanism which first estimates the coil profiles and then renders a final image that complies with the actual observations. Prior knowledge is introduced by penalizing edges in coil profiles and by a total variation constraint for the final image. The latter condition leads to an effective suppression of undersampling (streaking) artifacts and further adds a certain degree of denoising. Apart from simulations, experimental results for a radial spin‐echo {MRI} sequence are presented for phantoms and human brain in vivo at 2.9 T using 24, 48, and 96 spokes with 256 data samples. In comparison to conventional reconstructions (regridding) the proposed method yielded visually improved image quality in all cases. Magn Reson Med 57:1086–1098, 2007. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},

A constant azimuthal proﬁle spacing (111.246 ), based on the Golden Ratio, is investigated as optimal for image reconstruction from an arbitrary number of proﬁles in radial MRI. The proﬁle order is evaluated and compared with a uniform proﬁle distribution in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and artifact level. The favorable characteristics of such a proﬁle order are exempliﬁed in two applications on healthy volunteers. First, an advanced sliding window reconstruction scheme is applied to dynamic cardiac imaging, with a reconstruction window that can be ﬂexibly adjusted according to the extent of cardiac motion that is acceptable. Second, a contrast-enhancing -space ﬁlter is presented that permits reconstructing an arbitrary number of images at arbitrary time points from one raw data set. The ﬁlter was utilized to depict the T1-relaxation in the brain after a single inversion prepulse. While a uniform proﬁle distribution with a constant angle increment is optimal for a ﬁxed and predetermined number of proﬁles, a proﬁle distribution based on the Golden Ratio proved to be an appropriate solution for an arbitrary number of proﬁles.},

	abstract = {Background:
	The tibial tubercle–trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance was originally described for computed tomography (CT), but it has been measured on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with patellar instability (PI). Whether the TT-TG measured on CT versus MRI can be considered equivalent in skeletally immature children remains unclear.
	
	
	Purpose:
	To investigate in skeletally immature patients (1) the effects of CT versus MRI imaging modality and cartilage versus bony landmarks on consistency of TT-TG measurement, (2) the difference between CT and MRI measurements of the TT-TG, and (3) the difference in TT-TG between patients with and without PI.
	
	
	Study Design:
	Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.
	
	
	Methods:
	We retrospectively identified 24 skeletally immature patients with PI and 24 patients with other knee disorders or injury but without PI. The bony and cartilaginous TT-TG distances on CT and MRI were measured by 2 researchers, and related clinical data were collected. The interrater, interperiod (bony vs cartilaginous), and intermethod (CT vs MRI) reliabilities of TT-TG measurement were assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients.
	
	
	Results:
	The 48 study patients (19 boys, 29 girls) had a mean age of 11.3 years (range, 7-14 years). TT-TG measurements had excellent interrater reliability and good or excellent interperiod reliability but fair or poor intermethod reliability. TT-TG distance was greater on CT versus MRI (mean difference, 4.07 mm; 95\% CI, 2.6-5.5 mm), and cartilaginous distance was greater than bony distance (mean difference, 2.3 mm; 95\% CI, 0.79-3.8 mm). The TT-TG measured on CT was found to increase with the femoral width. Patients in the PI group had increased TT-TG distance compared with those in the control group, regardless of landmarks or modality used ( P {\textgreater} .05 for all).
	
	
	Conclusion:
	For skeletally immature patients, the TT-TG distance could be evaluated on MRI, regardless of whether cartilage or bony landmarks were used. Its value could not be interchanged with CT according to our results; however, further research on this topic is needed.},

	abstract = {Abstract
	For decades, researchers have observed that eccentric ({ECC}) muscle strength is greater than concentric ({CON}) muscle strength. However, knowledge of the {ECC}:{CON} strength ratio is incomplete and might inform resistance exercise prescriptions. Our purposes were to determine the magnitude of the {ECC}:{CON} ratio of human skeletal muscle in vivo and explore if sex, age, joint actions/exercises, and movement velocity impact it. A total of 340 studies were identified through searches. It was possible to analyse 1516 {ECC}:{CON} ratios, aggregated from 12,546 individuals who made up 564 groups in 335 of the identified studies. Approximately 98\% of measurements occurred on isokinetic machines. Bayesian meta-analyses were performed using log-ratios as response variables then exponentiated back to raw ratios. The overall main model estimate for the {ECC}:{CON} ratio was 1.41 (95\% credible interval [{CI}] 1.38–1.44). The {ECC}:{CON} ratio was slightly less in men (1.38 [{CI} 1.34–1.41]) than women (1.47 [{CI} 1.43–1.51]), and greater in older adults (1.62 [{CI} 1.57–1.68]) than younger adults (1.39 [{CI} 1.36–1.42]). The ratio was similar between grouped upper-body (1.42 [{CI} 1.38–1.46]) and lower-body joint actions/exercises (1.40 [{CI} 1.37–1.44]). However, heterogeneity in the ratio existed across joint actions/exercises, with point estimates ranging from 1.32 to 2.61. The {ECC}:{CON} ratio was most greatly impacted by movement velocity, with a 0.20\% increase in the ratio for every 1°/s increase in velocity. The results show that {ECC} muscle strength is {\textasciitilde} 40\% greater than {CON} muscle strength. However, the {ECC}:{CON} ratio is greatly affected by movement velocity and to lesser extents age and sex. Differences between joint actions/exercises likely exist, but more data are needed to provide more precise estimates.},

	volume = {9},
	doi = {10.1186/s40634-022-00540-5},
	abstract = {Abstract
	
	Purpose
	The menisci transmit load between femur and tibia and thus play a crucial role in the functionality of the knee joint. Knee joint movements have a major impact on the position of the menisci. However, these meniscus movements have not yet been assessed in a validated setting. The objective of this study is to evaluate the meniscal movements in {MRI} with prospective motion correction based on optical tracking under loading via internal and external tibial torques. 
	
	
	Methods
	Thirty-one healthy volunteers were recruited for this study. {MRI} scans were performed in internal and external rotation induced by a torque of 5 Nm, using a 3 T {MRI}. A validated software used the generated images to calculate the absolute meniscus movements as the sum of all vectors. Differences between subgroups were analyzed by using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. 
	
	
	Results
	The {MM} shows an average movement of 1.79 mm in anterior-lateral direction under internal rotation and 6.01 mm in posterior-lateral direction under external rotation, whereas the {LM} moves an average of 4.55 mm in posterior-medial direction under internal rotation and 3.58 mm in anterior-medial direction under external rotation. When comparing the overall meniscus movements between internal and external rotation, statistically significant differences were found for total vector length and the direction of meniscus movements for medial and lateral meniscus. The comparison between medial and lateral meniscus movements also showed statistically significant differences in all categories for internal and external rotation.
	
	
	Conclusions
	Overall, the {MM} and {LM} movements in internal and external rotation differ significantly in extent and direction, although {MM} and {LM} movements in opposite directions during internal and external rotation can be observed. In internal rotation, most meniscus movements were found in the {IHLM}. In external rotation, the {IHMM} showed the greatest mobility. Segment analysis of internal vs. external rotation showed less difference in {LM} movements than {MM}.

	abstract = {Subtle changes in knee kinematics may substantially alter cartilage contact patterns and moment generating capacities of soft tissues. The objective of this study was to use dynamic magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) to measure the inﬂuence of the timing of quadriceps loading on in vivo tibiofemoral and patellofemoral kinematics. We tested the hypothesis that load-dependent changes in knee kinematics would alter both the ﬁnite helical axis of the tibiofemoral joint and the moment arm of the patellar tendon. Eight healthy young adults were positioned supine in a {MRI}-compatible device that could impose either elastic or inertial loads on the lower leg in response to cyclic knee ﬂexion–extension. The elastic loading condition induced concentric quadriceps contractions with knee extension, while an inertial loading condition induced eccentric quadriceps contractions with knee ﬂexion. Peak internal knee extension moments ranged from 23 to 33 N m, which is comparable to loadings seen in normal walking. We found that anterior tibia translation, superior patella glide, and anterior patella translation were reduced by an average of 5.1, 5.7 and 2.9 mm when quadriceps loading coincided with knee ﬂexion rather than knee extension. These kinematic variations induced a distal shift in the ﬁnite helical axis of the tibiofemoral joint and a reduction in the patellar tendon moment arm. We conclude that it may be important to consider such load-dependent changes in knee kinematics when using models to ascertain soft tissue and cartilage loading during functional tasks such as gait.},

	abstract = {Background: The anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL}) has been well defined as the main passive restraint to anterior tibial translation ({ATT}) in the knee and plays an important role in rotational stability. However, it is unknown how closely the {ACL} and other passive and active structures of the knee constrain translations and rotations across a set of functional activities of increasing demand on the quadriceps.
	Hypothesis: Anterior tibial translation and internal rotation of the tibia relative to the femur would increase as the demand on the quadriceps increased.
	Study Design: Controlled laboratory study.
	
	Methods: The in vivo 3-dimensional knee kinematics of 10 adult female patients (height, 167.8 ± 7.1 cm; body mass, 57 ± 4 kg; body mass index [{BMI}], 24.8 ± 1.7 kg/m
	2
	; age, 29.7 ± 7.9 years) was measured using biplane fluoroscopy while patients completed 4 functional tasks. The tasks included an unloaded knee extension in which the patient slowly extended the knee from 90° to 0° of flexion in 2 seconds; walking at a constant pace of 90 steps per minute; a maximum effort isometric knee extension with the knee at 70° of flexion; and landing from a height of 40 cm in which the patient stepped off a box, landed, and immediately performed a maximum effort vertical jump.
	
	Results: Landing (5.6 ± 1.9 mm) produced significantly greater peak {ATT} than walking (3.1 ± 2.2 mm) and unweighted full extension (2.6 ± 2.1 mm) ( P {\textless} .01), but there was no difference between landing and a maximum isometric contraction (5.0 ± 1.9 mm). While there was no significant difference in peak internal rotation between landing (19.4° ± 5.7°), maximum isometric contraction (15.9° ± 6.7°), and unweighted full knee extension (14.5° ± 7.7°), each produced significantly greater internal rotation than walking (3.9° ± 4.2°) ( P {\textless} .001). Knee extension torque significantly increased for each task ( P {\textless} .01): unweighted knee extension (4.7 ± 1.2 N·m), walking (36.5 ± 7.9 N·m), maximum isometric knee extension (105.1 ± 8.2 N·m), and landing (140.2 ± 26.2 N·m).
	Conclusion: Anterior tibial translations significantly increased as demand on the quadriceps and external loading increased. Internal rotation was not significantly different between landing, isometric contraction, and unweighted knee extension. Additionally, {ATT} and internal rotation from each motion were within the normal range, and no excessive amounts of translation or rotation were observed.
	Clinical Relevance: This study demonstrated that while {ATT} will increase as demand on the quadriceps and external loading increases, the knee is able to effectively constrain {ATT} and internal rotation. This suggests that the healthy knee has a safe envelope of function that is tightly controlled even though task demand is elevated.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the screw-home movement at the tibiofemoral joint during normal gait by utilizing the 3-dimensional motion capture technique.
	{METHODS}: Fifteen young males and fifteen young females (total 60 knee joints) who had no history of musculoskeletal disease or a particular gait problem were included in this study. Two more markers were attached to the subject in addition to the Helen-Hayes marker set. Thus, two virtual planes, femoral coronal plane (P f ) and tibial coronal plane (P t ), were created by Skeletal Builder software. This study measured the 3-dimensional knee joint movement in the sagittal, coronal, and transverse planes of these two virtual planes (P f and P t ) during normal gait.
	{RESULTS}: With respect to kinematics and kinetics, both males and females showed normal adult gait patterns, and the mean difference in the temporal gait parameters was not statistically significant (p {\textgreater} 0.05). In the transverse plane, the screw-home movement occurred as expected during the pre-swing phase and the late-swing phase at an angle of about 17°. However, the tibia rotated externally with respect to the femur, rather than internally, while the knee joint started to flex during the loading response (paradoxical screw-home movement), and the angle was 6°.
	{CONCLUSIONS}: Paradoxical screw-home movement may be an important mechanism that provides stability to the knee joint during the remaining stance phase. Obtaining the kinematic values of the knee joint during gait can be useful in diagnosing and treating the pathological knee joints.},

	Background
	: Tibial rotation accompanying sagittal movement contains the phenomenon of screw-home movement of the knee, which plays an important role in knee stability during extension. This study aimed to investigate the alteration of screw-home movement in patients with knee osteoarthritis ({OA}).
	Methods
	: Participants (n =67) in this cross-sectional study were outpatients in the department of orthopedics of a general hospital and included patients with knee {OA} (n=31) and asymptomatic control subjects (n=36).Knee kinematic data were measured using an inertial measurement unit. The total tibial rotation was obtainedduring knee sagittal movement. The acquired angle of tibial rotation was divided into four periodseach extension and flexion. The total tibial rotation and the variation of each period were compared between the {OA} and control groups.
	Results
	: Significant differences arose between the {OA} and control groups in the total tibial rotation during knee extension and flexion(
	P
	{\textless} 0.001).The variation of tibial rotation was also significantly different between groups for all periods (
	P
	{\textless} 0.001; knee extensionat 70° to 45°,
	P
	= 0.014).
	Conclusions
	: We found a reduction in the total tibial rotation and loss of the screw-home movement in the unloaded {OA} knee. To normalize the screw-home movement, it is necessary to promote proper articular movement of the knee joint and suppress the hyperexcitability of the medial muscles.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Although previous studies on the screw-home movement ({SHM}) for autopsy specimen and walking of living persons conducted, the possibility of acquiring {SHM} based on inertial measurement units received little attention. This study aimed to investigate the possibility of measuring {SHM} for the non-weighted bearing using a micro-electro-mechanical system-based wearable motion capture system ({MEMSS}).
	Methods: {MEMSS} and camera-based motion analysis systems were used to obtain kinematic data of the knee joint. The knee joint moved from the flexion position to a fully extended position and then back to the start point. The coefficient of multiple correlation and the difference in the range of motion were used to assess the waveform similarity in the movement measured by two measurement systems.
	Results: The waveform similarity in the sagittal plane was excellent and the in the transverse plane was good. Significant differences were found in the sagittal plane between the two systems (p{\textless} 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the transverse plane between the two systems (p{\textgreater} 0.05).
	Conclusion: The {SHM} during the passive motion without muscle contraction in the non-weighted bearing appeared in the entire range. We thought that the {MEMSS} could be easily applied to the acquisition of biomechanical data on the knee related to physical therapy.},
