	abstract = {Introduction: This work aimed to develop a novel multipurpose device for guided knee ﬂexion-extension, both passively using a motorized pneumatic system and actively (muscle-driven) with the joint unloaded or loaded during dynamic MRI. Secondary objectives were to characterize the participant experience during device use, and present preliminary dynamic MRI data to demonstrate the different device capabilities. Material and methods: Self-reported outcomes were used to characterize the pain, physical exertion and discomfort levels experienced by 10 healthy male participants during four different active knee motion and loading protocols using the novel device. Knee angular data were recorded during the protocols to determine the maximum knee range of motion achievable. Dynamic MRI was acquired for three healthy volunteers during passive, unloaded knee motion using 2D Cartesian TSE, 2D radial GRE and 3D UTE sequences; and during active, unloaded and loaded knee motion using 2D radial GRE imaging. Because of the different MRI sequences used, spatial resolution was inherently lower for active knee motion than for passive motion acquisitions.
Results: Depending on the protocol, some participants reported slight pain, mild discomfort and varying levels of physical exertion. On average, participants achieved ∼40◦ of knee ﬂexion; loaded conditions can create knee moments up to 27 Nm. High quality imaging data were obtained during different motion and loading conditions. Dynamic 3D data allowed to retrospectively extract arbitrarily oriented slices.
Conclusion: A novel multipurpose device for guided, physiologically relevant knee motion and loading during dynamic MRI was developed. Device use was well tolerated and suitable for acquiring high quality images during different motion and loading conditions. Different bone positions between loaded and unloaded conditions were likely due to out-of-plane motion, particularly because image registration was not performed. Ultimately, this device could be used to advance our understanding of physiological and pathological joint mechanics.},

  abstract  = {The procedures and the nature of "technologies" are suggested to be broadly similar to those which characterize "science". In particular, there appear to be "technological paradigms" (or research programmes) performing a similar role to "scientific paradigms" (or research programmes). The model tries to account for both continuous changes and discontinuities in technological innovation. Continuous changes are often related to progress along a technological trajectory defined by a technological paradigm, while discontinuities are associated with the emergence of a new paradigm. One-directional explanations of the innovative process, and in particular those assuming "the market" as the prime mover, are inadequate to explain the emergence of new technological paradigms. The origin of the latter stems from the interplay between scientific advances, economic factors, institutional variables, and unsolved difficulties on established technological paths. The model tries to establish a sufficiently general framework which accounts for all these factors and to define the process of selection of new technological paradigms among a greater set of notionally possible ones. The history of a technology is contextual to the history of the industrial structures associated with that technology. The emergence of a new paradigm is often related to new "schumpeterian" companies, while its establishment often shows also a process of oligopolistic stabilization.},
