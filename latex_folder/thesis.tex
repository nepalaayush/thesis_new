\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


\subsection{Background}
Outline the importance of dynamic knee MRI and its applications in biomechanics. Review existing methods for analyzing dynamic knee MRI data. ** (need to think about this part.. how relevant is it to explain these methods? )

\subsection{Foundational Work}
Describe the two key papers that form the foundation of your thesis: the construction of the MRI knee loading device \parencite{brisson_novel_2022} and the development of the imaging sequence used for capturing data. \parencite{aleksiev_high-resolution_2022}

\subsection{Research Necessity}
Discuss the necessity for further analysis of the acquired images, emphasizing the gap between data collection and data interpretation within the current literature.

(was part of research objectives)
Clearly state the objectives of your research, focusing on the development of new analytical techniques to interpret the existing dynamic MRI data.

(was part of significance of study)
Explain the expected contributions of your research to the field, including the potential implications for biomechanical understanding and clinical applications.

\subsection{Thesis Structure}
Explain why this research is a logical next step following the development of the MRI knee loading device. 


\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:second}
some text 
\subsection{Data Collection Methods}
\subsubsection{The Device}
A novel MRI-compatible device was integrated into the MRI scanner setup to facilitate guided knee motion in patients \parencite{brisson_novel_2022}. This device allowed for a range of motion of approximately 30 degrees, enabling subjects to perform knee flexion and extension cycles under both loaded and unloaded conditions. For loading, the device was equipped with compartments for weight plates \underline{(maybe picture here?)} and sandbags, providing a physiological load of 10 to 12 kilograms. 


Central to this device's functionality is an optical fiber position sensor \underline{actual citation needed?}(MR338-Y10C10, Micronor, 155 Camarillo, CA, USA), which precisely  which measures the ab­
solute angle from 0{\degree}\,to 360\degree \, with a resolution of 0.025\degree. This measurement capability is critical for synchronizing the knee's movement with MRI data reconstruction. To enhance signal acquisition and the clarity of imaging, two flexible coils \underline{(cite the coils here, perhaps also show a picture)} were positioned at key anatomical locations: one at the distal femur and another at the proximal tibia, as specified in the MRI protocol. \underline{perhaps show a picture outside the scanner of the patient wearing it? }

\subsubsection{Procedure Details}
***MRI measurements were performed on four healthy volunteers (aged between 28 and 37 years, body mass between 55 and 90 kg) using a clinical 3 T Siemens Prisma fit scanner. Volunteers had no known musculoskeletal conditions and gave written informed consent in accordance with the guidelines set out by the institutional ethics committee.*** \underline{from device paper} For all of these subjects, the left leg was used. 

The thigh is secured on a wedge positioner, and the lower leg is attached to an ankle rest, just above the malleoli, using Velcro straps to minimize lateral movement. Once positioned at the scanner's isocenter, the volunteer then engages in a controlled exercise, following a metronome set at 60 beats per minute. This pace dictates a four-beat flexion to extension cycle, where the leg is flexed at the first beat and fully extended by the fourth. This exercise is performed for approximately 2 minutes throughout the duration of the scan, totaling between 100 to 120 repetitions. Initially conducted under a loaded condition with weights, the process is repeated without the added resistance to compare both states.

\subsubsection{Sequence Parameters and Reconstruction}


\subsection{Data Analysis}
All the analysis and data visualization were done using the python programming language (v3.11.5). To begin, the data in nifti (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) format is loaded using nibabel (v5.1.0) library. It is then visualized using napari(v0.4.18), a multi-dimensional interactive image viewer in Python. 
\subsubsection{Segmentation}
Step 1: Edge Detection Using the Canny Algorithm

The Canny filter \parencite{canny_computational_1986}, as implemented in the scikit-image's feature library (v0.21.0), was employed to apply an edge filter to the images. Various parameters of the Canny algorithm were adjusted, including edge thresholds and Gaussian blur, to optimize edge detection. Subsequently, the scikit-image's morphology library was utilized to remove small elements from the binary image. The image was then skeletonized to a one-pixel width, retaining only long and consistent edges. The final selection of the desired edge was accomplished using scipy's label algorithm (v1.11.3).

\subsection{Validity and Reliability}
