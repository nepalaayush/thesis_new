	abstract = {To explore and extend on dynamic imaging of joint motion, an {MRI}-safe device guiding knee motion with an attached rotary encoder was used in {MRI} measurements of multiple knee flexion-extension cycles using radial gradient echo imaging with the golden-angle as azimuthal angle increment. Reproducibility of knee motion was investigated. Real-time and {CINE} mode anatomical images were reconstructed for different knee flexion angles by synchronizing the encoder information with the {MRI} data, and performing flexion angle selective gating across multiple motion cycles. When investigating the influence of the rotation angle window width on recon­ structed {CINE} images, it was found that angle windows between 0.5◦ and 3◦ exhibited acceptable image sharpness without suffering from significant motion-induced blurring. Furthermore, due to flexible retrospective image reconstruction afforded by the radial golden-angle imaging, the number of motion cycles included in the reconstruction could be retrospectively reduced to investigate the corresponding influence of acquisition time on image quality. Finally, motion reproducibility between motion cycles and accuracy of the flexion angle selective gating were sufficient to acquire whole-knee 3D dynamic imaging with a retrospectively gated 3D cone {UTE} sequence.},
