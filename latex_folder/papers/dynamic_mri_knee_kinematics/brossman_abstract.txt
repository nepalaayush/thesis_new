abstract for 17: 

To evaluate the critical range of the patellofemoral joint motion from 30 degrees of knee flexion to full extension, motion-triggered cine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed during active extension in 13 patients with confirmed patellar maltracking and 15 healthy subjects. Cine MR images were compared with static MR images obtained during incremental extension of the knee joint. To evaluate the patellar tracking pattern, the same imaging parameters (patellar tilt angle, bisect offset, and lateral patellar displacement) and section locations were used in the static and motion-triggered studies. Statistically significant differences between the passive and active knee motions were found in all three parameters in the group of patients and in the bisect offset in the control group. The comparison between patients and healthy subjects yielded statistically significant differences for all parameters in actively extended knees but not in passively extended knees. The results demonstrate the importance of dynamic patellar motion studies for diagnosis of patello-femoral maltracking.
