              Background
              Whether the medial meniscus morphology and movement occur under upright loading conditions in early knee osteoarthritis ({OA}) or medial meniscus posterior root tear ({MMPRT}) remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the medial and anteroposterior extrusion of the medial meniscus under unloaded and upright-loaded conditions in patients with early knee {OA}.
            
            
              Methods
              Twelve patients with early knee {OA} and 18 healthy adult volunteers participated in this study. Magnetic resonance imaging using special equipment was performed with the participants in the unloaded and upright-loaded conditions. Medial, anterior, and posterior extrusions of the medial meniscus against the tibial edge were evaluated and compared between the early knee {OA} and healthy adult control groups. Additionally, 12 patients in the early knee {OA} group were divided into 2 subgroups based on whether {MMPRT} was observed, and the extrusion of the medial meniscus was compared.
            
            
              Results
              The amount of medial extrusion of the medial meniscus in both the unloaded and upright-loaded conditions was significantly greater in the early knee {OA} group than in the control group (unloaded: 2.6 ± 1.0 mm vs 0.7 ± 0.5 mm; upright-loaded: 3.7 ± 0.9 mm vs 1.8 ± 0.8 mm). Similarly, the anterior and posterior extrusion of the medial meniscus in the upright-loaded condition was significantly larger in the early knee {OA} group (anterior: 4.6 ± 1.0 mm vs 3.7 ± 1.1 mm; posterior: -3.4 ± 1.1 mm vs -4.6 ± 1.6 mm). However, no difference was observed in meniscal extrusion between unloaded and upright-loaded conditions. The posterior extrusion of the medial meniscus in the upright-loaded condition was significantly greater in {MMPRT} cases than in non-{MMPRT} cases in the early knee {OA} group ({MMPRT}: -2.7 ± 1.1 mm; non-{MMPRT} -4.1 ± 1.5 mm).
            
            
              Conclusions
              In early knee {OA}, significantly large meniscal extrusions of the medial meniscus in both unloaded and upright-loaded conditions were found compared with healthy adults. Among patients with early knee {OA}, those with {MMPRT} showed a large posterior extrusion of the medial meniscus in the upright-loaded condition compared with those without {MMPRT}.
