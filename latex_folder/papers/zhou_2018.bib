              To describe and evaluate a new segmentation method using deep convolutional neural network ({CNN}), 3D fully connected conditional random field ({CRF}), and 3D simplex deformable modeling to improve the efficiency and accuracy of knee joint tissue segmentation.
            
            
              Methods
              A segmentation pipeline was built by combining a semantic segmentation {CNN}, 3D fully connected {CRF}, and 3D simplex deformable modeling. A convolutional encoder‐decoder network was designed as the core of the segmentation method to perform high resolution pixel‐wise multi‐class tissue classification for 12 different joint structures. The 3D fully connected {CRF} was applied to regularize contextual relationship among voxels within the same tissue class and between different classes. The 3D simplex deformable modeling refined the output from 3D {CRF} to preserve the overall shape and maintain a desirable smooth surface for joint structures. The method was evaluated on 3D fast spin‐echo (3D‐{FSE}) {MR} image data sets. Quantitative morphological metrics were used to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the method in comparison to the ground truth data.
            
            
              Results
              The proposed segmentation method provided good performance for segmenting all knee joint structures. There were 4 tissue types with high mean Dice coefficient above 0.9 including the femur, tibia, muscle, and other non‐specified tissues. There were 7 tissue types with mean Dice coefficient between 0.8 and 0.9 including the femoral cartilage, tibial cartilage, patella, patellar cartilage, meniscus, quadriceps and patellar tendon, and infrapatellar fat pad. There was 1 tissue type with mean Dice coefficient between 0.7 and 0.8 for joint effusion and Baker's cyst. Most musculoskeletal tissues had a mean value of average symmetric surface distance below 1 mm.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The combined {CNN}, 3D fully connected {CRF}, and 3D deformable modeling approach was well‐suited for performing rapid and accurate comprehensive tissue segmentation of the knee joint. The deep learning‐based segmentation method has promising potential applications in musculoskeletal imaging.},
