            For decades, researchers have observed that eccentric ({ECC}) muscle strength is greater than concentric ({CON}) muscle strength. However, knowledge of the {ECC}:{CON} strength ratio is incomplete and might inform resistance exercise prescriptions. Our purposes were to determine the magnitude of the {ECC}:{CON} ratio of human skeletal muscle in vivo and explore if sex, age, joint actions/exercises, and movement velocity impact it. A total of 340 studies were identified through searches. It was possible to analyse 1516 {ECC}:{CON} ratios, aggregated from 12,546 individuals who made up 564 groups in 335 of the identified studies. Approximately 98\% of measurements occurred on isokinetic machines. Bayesian meta-analyses were performed using log-ratios as response variables then exponentiated back to raw ratios. The overall main model estimate for the {ECC}:{CON} ratio was 1.41 (95\% credible interval [{CI}] 1.38–1.44). The {ECC}:{CON} ratio was slightly less in men (1.38 [{CI} 1.34–1.41]) than women (1.47 [{CI} 1.43–1.51]), and greater in older adults (1.62 [{CI} 1.57–1.68]) than younger adults (1.39 [{CI} 1.36–1.42]). The ratio was similar between grouped upper-body (1.42 [{CI} 1.38–1.46]) and lower-body joint actions/exercises (1.40 [{CI} 1.37–1.44]). However, heterogeneity in the ratio existed across joint actions/exercises, with point estimates ranging from 1.32 to 2.61. The {ECC}:{CON} ratio was most greatly impacted by movement velocity, with a 0.20\% increase in the ratio for every 1°/s increase in velocity. The results show that {ECC} muscle strength is {\textasciitilde} 40\% greater than {CON} muscle strength. However, the {ECC}:{CON} ratio is greatly affected by movement velocity and to lesser extents age and sex. Differences between joint actions/exercises likely exist, but more data are needed to provide more precise estimates.},
