              To evaluate the relationship between mechanical loading, as indicated by the external knee adduction moment ({KAM}) during walking, and {BML} on {MRI} in people with medial knee osteoarthritis.
            
            
              Methods
              Measures were taken in 91 individuals with medial knee osteoarthritis. Logistic regression analyses were performed with the presence/absence of medial tibial or medial femoral {BML} as the outcome and either peak {KAM} or {KAM} impulse as the independent variable. Analyses were also adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, alignment and walking speed.
            
            
              Results
              In adjusted analyses, peak {KAM} was significantly related to medial tibial ({OR} 2.3; 95\%{CI} 1.07 to 4.7), but not medial femoral ({OR} 1.85; 95\%{CI} 0.93 to 3.7) {BML}. {KAM} impulse was significantly related to both medial tibial ({OR} 9.4; 95\%{CI} 1.53 to 57.2) and medial femoral ({OR} 14.4; 95\%{CI} 2.3 to 89.8) {BML}.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The findings support the hypothesis that greater mechanical loading of the medial compartment plays a role in the pathogenesis of {BML} in medial tibiofemoral osteoarthritis.},
