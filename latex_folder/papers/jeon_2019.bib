	abstract = {Purpose: Although previous studies on the screw-home movement ({SHM}) for autopsy specimen and walking of living persons conducted, the possibility of acquiring {SHM} based on inertial measurement units received little attention. This study aimed to investigate the possibility of measuring {SHM} for the non-weighted bearing using a micro-electro-mechanical system-based wearable motion capture system ({MEMSS}).
Methods: {MEMSS} and camera-based motion analysis systems were used to obtain kinematic data of the knee joint. The knee joint moved from the flexion position to a fully extended position and then back to the start point. The coefficient of multiple correlation and the difference in the range of motion were used to assess the waveform similarity in the movement measured by two measurement systems.
Results: The waveform similarity in the sagittal plane was excellent and the in the transverse plane was good. Significant differences were found in the sagittal plane between the two systems (p{\textless} 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the transverse plane between the two systems (p{\textgreater} 0.05).
Conclusion: The {SHM} during the passive motion without muscle contraction in the non-weighted bearing appeared in the entire range. We thought that the {MEMSS} could be easily applied to the acquisition of biomechanical data on the knee related to physical therapy.},
