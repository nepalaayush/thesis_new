	abstract = {Objective: Osteoarthritis of the knee (knee {OA}) is a serious joint disease leading to pain and reduced quality of life. Pharmacological treatments include anti-inﬂammatories, analgesics, intraarticular hyaluronic acid, and intraarticular corticosteroids while for severe knee {OA}, knee replacement is an option. This study examined the incidence, prevalence, patient characteristics, and uptake of medical and surgical treatments in knee {OA} patients in Germany. Design: A non-interventional, retrospective health claims data analysis with anonymized data from the {InGef} database was performed. Patients  18 years were analyzed cross-sectionally for each year 2015–2020. Newly diagnosed patients in 2015 were also longitudinally analyzed until end of 2020.
Results: Annual knee {OA} prevalence increased from 7.07 \% in 2015 to 7.39 \% in 2020. Annual incidence proportions ranged from 1.71 \% in 2015 to 1.46 \% in 2020. Knee replacement was the most common surgery, with rising patient numbers (e.g., 7918 patients in 2015 and 8975 patients in 2019). Approximately 62 \% of patients newly diagnosed in 2015 received prescription pharmacological pain treatment during follow-up. Most (96.95 \%) received non-opioid analgesics, followed by weak opioids (8.14 \%) and strong opioids (3.00 \%) as ﬁrst-line treatment (combinations possible). Knee surgery was performed in 16.6 \% of patients during follow-up. Median time from ﬁrst diagnosis until surgery was 346 days for any knee surgery and 564 days for knee replacement.
Conclusions: The number of patients with knee {OA} in Germany is steadily rising, along with an increasing number of surgical interventions, especially knee replacement. Time until ﬁrst surgery and knee replacement is relatively short, even for newly diagnosed patients.},
