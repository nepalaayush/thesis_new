              Purpose
              The menisci transmit load between femur and tibia and thus play a crucial role in the functionality of the knee joint. Knee joint movements have a major impact on the position of the menisci. However, these meniscus movements have not yet been assessed in a validated setting. The objective of this study is to evaluate the meniscal movements in {MRI} with prospective motion correction based on optical tracking under loading via internal and external tibial torques. 
            
            
              Methods
              Thirty-one healthy volunteers were recruited for this study. {MRI} scans were performed in internal and external rotation induced by a torque of 5 Nm, using a 3 T {MRI}. A validated software used the generated images to calculate the absolute meniscus movements as the sum of all vectors. Differences between subgroups were analyzed by using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. 
            
            
              Results
              The {MM} shows an average movement of 1.79 mm in anterior-lateral direction under internal rotation and 6.01 mm in posterior-lateral direction under external rotation, whereas the {LM} moves an average of 4.55 mm in posterior-medial direction under internal rotation and 3.58 mm in anterior-medial direction under external rotation. When comparing the overall meniscus movements between internal and external rotation, statistically significant differences were found for total vector length and the direction of meniscus movements for medial and lateral meniscus. The comparison between medial and lateral meniscus movements also showed statistically significant differences in all categories for internal and external rotation.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Overall, the {MM} and {LM} movements in internal and external rotation differ significantly in extent and direction, although {MM} and {LM} movements in opposite directions during internal and external rotation can be observed. In internal rotation, most meniscus movements were found in the {IHLM}. In external rotation, the {IHMM} showed the greatest mobility. Segment analysis of internal vs. external rotation showed less difference in {LM} movements than {MM}.
