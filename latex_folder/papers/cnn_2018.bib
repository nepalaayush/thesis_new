	abstract = {Purpose
              To describe and evaluate a new fully automated musculoskeletal tissue segmentation method using deep convolutional neural network ({CNN}) and three‐dimensional (3D) simplex deformable modeling to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cartilage and bone segmentation within the knee joint.
            
            
              Methods
              A fully automated segmentation pipeline was built by combining a semantic segmentation {CNN} and 3D simplex deformable modeling. A {CNN} technique called {SegNet} was applied as the core of the segmentation method to perform high resolution pixel‐wise multi‐class tissue classification. The 3D simplex deformable modeling refined the output from {SegNet} to preserve the overall shape and maintain a desirable smooth surface for musculoskeletal structure. The fully automated segmentation method was tested using a publicly available knee image data set to compare with currently used state‐of‐the‐art segmentation methods. The fully automated method was also evaluated on two different data sets, which include morphological and quantitative {MR} images with different tissue contrasts.
            
            
              Results
              The proposed fully automated segmentation method provided good segmentation performance with segmentation accuracy superior to most of state‐of‐the‐art methods in the publicly available knee image data set. The method also demonstrated versatile segmentation performance on both morphological and quantitative musculoskeletal {MR} images with different tissue contrasts and spatial resolutions.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The study demonstrates that the combined {CNN} and 3D deformable modeling approach is useful for performing rapid and accurate cartilage and bone segmentation within the knee joint. The {CNN} has promising potential applications in musculoskeletal imaging. Magn Reson Med 79:2379–2391, 2018. © 2017 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.},
