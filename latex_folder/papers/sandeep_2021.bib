              Knee assessment with and without load using magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) can provide information on knee joint dynamics and improve the diagnosis of knee joint diseases. Performing such studies on a routine {MRI}‐scanner require a load‐exerting device during scanning. There is a need for more studies on developing loading devices and evaluating their clinical potential.
            
            
              Purpose
              Design and develop a portable and easy‐to‐use axial loading device to evaluate the knee joint dynamics during the {MRI} study.

              Assessment
              
                Design and development of loading device, calibration of loads, {MR} safety assessment (using projectile angular displacement, torque, and temperature tests). Scoring system for ease of doing. Qualitative (by radiologist) and quantitative (using structural similarity index measure [{SSIM}]) image‐artifact assessment. Evaluation of repeatability, comparison with various standing stances load, and loading effect on knee {MR} parameters (tibiofemoral bone gap [{TFBG}], femoral cartilage thickness [{FCT}], tibial cartilage thickness [{TCT}], femoral cartilage T

                ‐value [{TCT}2]). The relative percentage change ({RPC}) in parameters due to the device load was computed.

              Results
              
                The developed device is conditional‐{MR} safe (details in the manuscript and supplementary materials), 15 × 15 × 45 cm

                dimension, and {\textless}3 kg. The ease of using the device was 4.9/5. The device introduced no visible image artifacts, and {SSIM} of 0.9889 ± 0.0153 was observed. The {TFBG} intraobserver variability (absolute difference) was {\textless}0.1 mm. Interobserver variability of all regions of interest was {\textless}0.1 mm. The load exerted by the device was close to the load during standing on both legs in 0.25 T scanner with r {\textgreater} 0.9. Loading resulted in {RPC} of 1.5\%–11.0\%, 7.9\%–8.5\%, and −1.5\% to 13.0\% in the {TFBG}, {FCT}, and {TCT}, respectively. {FCT}2 and {TCT}2 were reduced in range of 1.5–2.7 msec and 0.5–2.3 msec due to load.
              
            
            
              Data Conclusion
              The proposed device is conditionally {MR} safe, low cost (material cost {\textless} {INR} 6000), portable, and effective in loading the knee joint with up to 50\% of body weight.
