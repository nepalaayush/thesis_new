            Over the past 30 years, research on meniscal kinematics has been limited by challenges such as low-resolution imaging and capturing continuous motion from static data. This study aimed to develop a computational knee model that overcomes these limitations and enables the continuous assessment of meniscal dynamics. A high-resolution {MRI} dataset (n = 11) was acquired in 4 configurations of knee flexion. In each configuration, the menisci were modeled based on the underlying osseous anatomy. Principal Polynomial Shape Analysis ({PPSA}) was employed for continuous meniscal modeling. Maximal medial anterior horn displacement occurred in 60° of flexion, equaling 6.24 mm posteromedial, while the posterior horn remained relatively stable. At 90° of flexion, the lateral anterior and posterior horn displaced posteromedially, amounting 5.70 mm and 6.51 mm respectively. The maximal observed Average Surface Distance ({ASD}) equaled 0.70 mm for lateral meniscal modeling in 90° of flexion. Based on our results, a strong relation between meniscal dynamics and tibiofemoral kinematics was confirmed. Expanding on static meniscal modeling and employing {PPSA}, we derived and validated a standardized and systematic methodological workflow.},
