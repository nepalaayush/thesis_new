	abstract = {Background: The anterior cruciate ligament ({ACL}) has been well defined as the main passive restraint to anterior tibial translation ({ATT}) in the knee and plays an important role in rotational stability. However, it is unknown how closely the {ACL} and other passive and active structures of the knee constrain translations and rotations across a set of functional activities of increasing demand on the quadriceps.
            Hypothesis: Anterior tibial translation and internal rotation of the tibia relative to the femur would increase as the demand on the quadriceps increased.
            Study Design: Controlled laboratory study.
            
              Methods: The in vivo 3-dimensional knee kinematics of 10 adult female patients (height, 167.8 ± 7.1 cm; body mass, 57 ± 4 kg; body mass index [{BMI}], 24.8 ± 1.7 kg/m
              2
              ; age, 29.7 ± 7.9 years) was measured using biplane fluoroscopy while patients completed 4 functional tasks. The tasks included an unloaded knee extension in which the patient slowly extended the knee from 90° to 0° of flexion in 2 seconds; walking at a constant pace of 90 steps per minute; a maximum effort isometric knee extension with the knee at 70° of flexion; and landing from a height of 40 cm in which the patient stepped off a box, landed, and immediately performed a maximum effort vertical jump.
            
            Results: Landing (5.6 ± 1.9 mm) produced significantly greater peak {ATT} than walking (3.1 ± 2.2 mm) and unweighted full extension (2.6 ± 2.1 mm) ( P {\textless} .01), but there was no difference between landing and a maximum isometric contraction (5.0 ± 1.9 mm). While there was no significant difference in peak internal rotation between landing (19.4° ± 5.7°), maximum isometric contraction (15.9° ± 6.7°), and unweighted full knee extension (14.5° ± 7.7°), each produced significantly greater internal rotation than walking (3.9° ± 4.2°) ( P {\textless} .001). Knee extension torque significantly increased for each task ( P {\textless} .01): unweighted knee extension (4.7 ± 1.2 N·m), walking (36.5 ± 7.9 N·m), maximum isometric knee extension (105.1 ± 8.2 N·m), and landing (140.2 ± 26.2 N·m).
            Conclusion: Anterior tibial translations significantly increased as demand on the quadriceps and external loading increased. Internal rotation was not significantly different between landing, isometric contraction, and unweighted knee extension. Additionally, {ATT} and internal rotation from each motion were within the normal range, and no excessive amounts of translation or rotation were observed.
            Clinical Relevance: This study demonstrated that while {ATT} will increase as demand on the quadriceps and external loading increases, the knee is able to effectively constrain {ATT} and internal rotation. This suggests that the healthy knee has a safe envelope of function that is tightly controlled even though task demand is elevated.},
