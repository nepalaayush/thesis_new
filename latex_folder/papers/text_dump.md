Anatomical terms: 

Shaft: the long cylindrical portion of the  bone. 

external condyle of femur: more prominent anteriorly, and is broader both in the antero-posterior and transverse diameters 
internal condyle of the femur: narrower, longer and more prominent inferiorly. 

joints: read this from the susan stranding grey's anatomy, and can start with describing the knee joint as this type of particualr joint. ... moore says it is a type of synovial joint 
Synovial joint: These are freely moving joints in which the articulating bony surfaces are covered in smooth (hyaline) articular cartilage and separated by a film of viscous synovial fluid that serves as a lubricant. (susan, page 97, 41st ed)

- this is the device paper. very small portion in a journal i guess.

- also relevant because now it is dynamic and mri and normal knee kinematics, which is exactly what im doing right now.

- a review paper. not specifically to do with dynamic images, but still, it is mri studies of knee joint under loading.
