	abstract = {In dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, the motion kinetics or the contrast variability are often hard to predict, hampering an appropriate choice of the image update rate or the temporal resolution. A constant azimuthal proﬁle spacing (111.246 ), based on the Golden Ratio, is investigated as optimal for image reconstruction from an arbitrary number of proﬁles in radial MRI. The proﬁle order is evaluated and compared with a uniform proﬁle distribution in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and artifact level. The favorable characteristics of such a proﬁle order are exempliﬁed in two applications on healthy volunteers. First, an advanced sliding window reconstruction scheme is applied to dynamic cardiac imaging, with a reconstruction window that can be ﬂexibly adjusted according to the extent of cardiac motion that is acceptable. Second, a contrast-enhancing -space ﬁlter is presented that permits reconstructing an arbitrary number of images at arbitrary time points from one raw data set. The ﬁlter was utilized to depict the T1-relaxation in the brain after a single inversion prepulse. While a uniform proﬁle distribution with a constant angle increment is optimal for a ﬁxed and predetermined number of proﬁles, a proﬁle distribution based on the Golden Ratio proved to be an appropriate solution for an arbitrary number of proﬁles.},
