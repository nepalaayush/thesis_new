	abstract = {Fundamentals of MRI: An Interactive Learning Approach explores the physical principles that underpin the technique of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). After covering background mathematics, physics, and digital imaging, the book presents fundamental physical principles, including magnetization and rotating reference frame. It describes how relaxation mechanisms help predict tissue contrast and how an MR signal is localized to a selected slice through the body. The text then focuses on frequency and phase encoding. It also explores the spin-echo sequence, its scan parameters, and additional ima},
