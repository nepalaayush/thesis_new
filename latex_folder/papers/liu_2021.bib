            There are few studies investigate morphologic changes of knee meniscus in vivo mechanical loading and three-dimensions (3D) deformation and displacement of the whole meniscus between in vivo mechanical loading and unloading conditions are still unclear. To investigate the displacements and 3D morphological changes of the menisci under knee weight-bearing and early flexion conditions in healthy adults using a Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({MRI})-compatible loading device (a 3.0 T {MR} imaging system) combined with a newly developed 3D comparison technique. Fifteen healthy volunteers were recruited in this cross-sectional observational study. Each subject underwent {MRIs} of their dominant right knee in eight different scanning conditions using a 3.0-T {MRI} scanner with a custom-made {MRI}-compatible loading device. The knee meniscus images were 3D reconstructed, and dimensional comparisons were made for each meniscal model with baseline (0°-unloaded model). The morphologic changes of the meniscal-anterior horn ({AH}), body ({BD}), and posterior horn ({PH}) regions were expressed as mean positive and negative deviations. The displacements were further investigated, and the meniscal extrusions of different subregions were measured. The morphologic changing patterns of human meniscus under loading and flexions were presented using 3D chromatic maps. The bilateral menisci were generally shifting laterally and posteriorly in most flexion angles and were changing medially and anteriorly under fully extended knee loading conditions. The mean deviations were more significant with loading at 0° of knee flexion, while the {PH} region in the lateral side changed further posteriorly with loading in 30° flexion. Most of the differences were not significant in other flexion angles between loading conditions. The extrusion of meniscus’s medial body was greater in full extension compared to any other flexing angles. Mechanical loading can significantly deform the menisci in knee extension; however, this effect is limited during knee flexion. Current study can be used as a reference for the evaluations of the integrity in meniscal functions.},
