              Background
              Investigation of the association between leg axis alignment and biochemical {MRI} in young professional soccer players in order to identify a potential influence of the leg axis on cartilage regions at risk.
            
            
              Methods
              Sixteen professional soccer players (21 ± 3 years) underwent static and dynamic leg axis analysis via radiation free {DIERS} formetric 4 D as well as 3-T {MRI} examination of both knees. Quantitative T2* mapping of the knee cartilage was performed and T2* values were evaluated as 144 regions of interest. Subgroup analysis was performed in players with severe varus alignment ({\textgreater} 6°).
            
            
              Results
              
                Analysis of the leg axis geometry revealed a mean static alignment of 6.6° ± 2.5 varus and a mean dynamic alignment of 5.1° ± 2.6 varus. Quantitative T2* mapping showed significantly increased T2* values in the superficial cartilage layer compared to the deeper region (
                p
                 {\textless} 0.001) as well as a significant increase in relaxation times in the femoral cartilage from anterior to intermediate to posterior (
                p
                 {\textless} 0.001). Combination of both methods revealed a significant correlation for the degree of varus alignment and the femoral, posterior, deep region of the medial knee compartment (
                r
                 = 0.4;
                p
                 = 0.03). If severe varus alignment was present this region showed a significant increase in relaxation time compared to players with a less pronounced leg axis deviation (
                p
                 = 0.003).
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              This study demonstrates that varus alignment in young soccer players is associated with elevated T2* relaxation times in the deep cartilage layer of the medial, posterior, femoral compartment and might therefore be a contributing factor in the early pathogenesis of manifest cartilage lesions. Therefore, these findings should be considered in the development of preventive training programs.},
