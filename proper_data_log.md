**Subjects: MM **

datasets from 26.01 and before, call it 'old'

for NW: 

TO DO:  

1. reco using 2 angle increments. 

2. do fem segmentation first

for W: 

1. reco using the partial repetion and see if it gets better and obtain the data 

Results: 
NW: indeed, there is the cumulative deviation after a certain angle. 

___________________________________________________________________

For data acquired on 26.01 

NW and W both are decent datasets

need to redo the NW part to explain this final frame weirdness.

For the subject MK: 

have two datasets one for left leg and one for right leg 

For left leg:

Not bad but still a bit of deviation. 

- the femur looks fine no through plane motion here 

TO DO: have to do the proper regardless, so need to do again, no ref frame 

re calculating the transformation matrices, twice, the result is a bit deviation near the plateau:

This was improved, the mae, by tweaking the curve of the first frame. still not a satisfactory result.

For MK data taken on 02.02: 

Starting with NW: 

- [x] final label tib 

- [x] t matrix 

- [x] ref frame 

- [x] segmented shape 

- [x] info dict 

But the analysis part is messed up because the orientation is the opposite.

very nice looking plot at least for the centroid. worth looking into. 

MK_W_02.02: (just reverse the order and do it once more .)

- [ ] final label tib

- [ ] t matrix

- [ ] ref frame

- [ ] segmented shape

- [ ] info dict

- [ ] final label fem
  
  - [ ] t matrix
  
  - [ ] ref frame
  
  - [ ] segmented shape
  
  - [ ] info dict

super weird stuff. so, the angles do not make sense AT all, there is total deviation. . but for the one i did previously, there is NO deviation. one of the best datasets. so why? i even removed the first reference frame and then did it again, but am facing the same problem. 

- All i want to do now, is to just obtain one single decent loaded and unloaded case. so maybe simply cheat the system and do it as is .using the other ref matrices. 

here is what is new: 
it absolutely matters if we start from the first frame or the last. it really doesnt matter if it is extended or flexed. the results can vastly vary, even though the final label is the same. this seems super odd.. but it has to do with the cumulation of errors here. 

For AN NW:

super bad angles, this was going from first frame to last, where first was fully extended 

![](C:\Users\Aayush\AppData\Roaming\marktext\images\2024-02-09-18-50-55-image.png)

now this is from last to first. here, the first two are actually behaving well. even though from third, we would expect some kind of deviation, but that simply does not happen. 

Now, here is the most radical idea: complete manual segmentation, no edge image at ALL! 

: ![](C:\Users\Aayush\AppData\Roaming\marktext\images\2024-02-09-19-03-40-image.png)

slightly better than the edge, but still pretty bad.

- Mention dr. Kr√§mer that the extension for the subjects should be forced to go all the way.
