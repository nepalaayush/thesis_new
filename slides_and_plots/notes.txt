- normalize the y axis further ... maybe divide it by the extended? 
- schedule a meeting with Nick after you finish the analysis. 
- see if that is what we expect ... what are our hypothesis 


- regarding cine intro: 
if we want to show how the k space is being filled across the repetitions ... just use the cine_radial_2d script , and leave the sum of squares in but remove the fft. then , for the sensor graph, you can actually use the -vv parameter .. we can then change the plotting however we like to put in the thesis ... also a worth to check out the aleksiev"s thesis and see what he has done .
