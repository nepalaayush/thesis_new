	abstract = {The rising cost of musculoskeletal pathology, disease, and injury creates a pressing need for accurate and reliable methods to quantify 3D musculoskeletal motion, fostering a renewed interest in this area over the past few years. To date, cine-phase contrast ({PC}) {MRI} remains the only technique capable of non-invasively tracking in vivo 3D musculoskeletal motion during volitional activity, but current scan times are long on the 1.5T {MR} platform (∼ 2.5 min or 75 movement cycles). With the clinical availability of higher field strength magnets (3.0T) that have increased signal-to-noise ratios, it is likely that scan times can be reduced while improving accuracy. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to validate cine-{PC} {MRI} on a 3.0T platform, in terms of accuracy, precision, and subject-repeatability, and to determine if scan time could be minimized. On the 3.0T platform it is possible to limit scan time to 2 min, with sub-millimeter accuracy ({\textless}0.33 mm/0.97°), excellent technique precision ({\textless}0.18°), and strong subject-repeatability ({\textless}0.73 mm/1.10°). This represents reduction in imaging time by 25\% (42 s), a 50\% improvement in accuracy, and a 72\% improvement in technique precision over the original 1.5T platform. Scan time can be reduced to 1 min (30 movement cycles), but the improvements in accuracy are not as large.},
