              Purpose
              To examine the precision of cine‐phase contrast ({PC}) magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) techniques as applied to the quantification of three‐dimensional knee joint kinematics.
            
            
              Materials and Methods
              The knee joints of eight healthy volunteers were studied using three different dynamic, {PC} {MRI} protocols: cine‐{PC} (one average), cine‐{PC} (two averages), and cine‐{PC} with segmented phase encoding (fast‐{PC}).
            
            
              Results
              Fast‐{PC} has comparable precision, shorter scan times, and improved subject interexam variability ({SIEV}) compared to cine‐{PC} (two averages). Further, cine‐{PC} (one average) has low precision and high {SIEV}, making fast‐{PC} the preferred method of data acquisition. Specifically, the precision of fast‐{PC} {MRI} in measuring knee joint kinematics ranged from 0.22°–1.16°.
            
            
              Conclusion
              A cine‐{PC} {MRI} technique utilizing segmented phase encoding (fast‐{PC} {MRI}) acquires dynamic data at a faster rate than other {PC} imaging protocols, without compromising data precision. Being able to acquire precise 3D kinematics with shorter imaging times is critical if we are to use this technique to advance ongoing research in musculoskeletal kinematics. J. Magn. Reson.
