Author Guide: 

- TTN: Please be sure to specify the manuscript type in your cover letter.

In order to be considered for publication, all submissions, regardless of manuscript type, must be carefully and concisely prepared. Magn Reson Med publishes the following manuscript types:

- Technical Notes are complete accounts of technical work of a limited scope but may also describe methodologically-orientated clinical studies of a limited scope or other such limited studies.

Technical Note 	2800 words 	5 figures plus tables 


Q. how many words per say? 
ans: 

- TTN: Corresponding author: Only one author may be listed as the corresponding author. The corresponding author need not be the first author. The Scholar One electronic manuscript submission process also allows the submitting author to be different from the designated corresponding author.

Magn Reson Med prefers authors to be listed without details of relative status but allows specifications of the contributions made by the co- authors in the Acknowledgement section of the manuscript. If the authors consider it essential and justified to indicate more prominently that two authors are equal in status, they may be identified with the caption ‘Author X and Author Y contributed equally to this work’ in the author’s footnote on the title page. If more than two co-authors are of equal status, however, this can only be indicated in the Acknowledgement section of the manuscript. Exceptional deviations from this require explicit permission of the Editor-in-Chief.

- TTN: Novelty: Any prior publication containing overlapping material by the author(s) must be cited in the references and should also be mentioned in the submission cover letter. In this case, novelty of the Magn Reson Med submission will be assessed based on its incremental novelty over and beyond the prior publication. 


- TTN: Formatting: Please use 
- 1.5 line spacing throughout on 
- 8 ½ by 11 inch or A4 format 
- with margins on all sides (how big are the margins?) 
- and in a basic font (e.g., Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Times New Roman) of at least 11 point throughout. 
- All pages should be numbered consecutively, including references, tables, and figure legends. Manuscripts that fail to conform to the organization requirements may require resubmission, with the consequent loss of the earlier submission date.

- Text. Please prepare your manuscript text using MS Word (preferred method)!, Rich Text format, or LaTeX. Please find an MRM LaTeX template available at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15222594/la_tex_class_file.

- PDF Manuscript Submissions. PDF submission for original submissions (not revisions, except for LaTeX submissions) is allowed, although not encouraged

- Word count only includes the body of the text (and appendices, when present) and not the title page, abstract, figure captions, tables, table captions, or references,  institution information, and key words.

Everything to do with figures: 

from the author guidelines: 

Figures. Figures should be numbered in the sequence in which they are mentioned in the text. Figure callouts should be spelled out in the text (e.g., “Figure 1”). All figure sub-parts should be labeled A, B, C, etc. Symbols, letters, and numbers must be legible after reduction, at which time, the smallest data points should not be less than 1.5- to 1.7 mm high. Images need to be cropped and all irrelevant parts removed. Be sure to remove all patient or subject identifying information. Avoid the use of thin lines (1-point or thinner) and remove manufacturer’s annotation on images. Crop images to minimize the area devoid of information.

- To facilitate review, figures may be embedded within the manuscript text but must also be uploaded as individual image files. The authors’ placement of figures within the text will have no bearing on the final production layout, should the paper be accepted.

Figures should be submitted in formats based on image type. Please visit https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/Prepare/manuscript-preparation-guidelines.html/figure-preparation.html for more detailed information. Although native files are preferred, PDF image files are permitted. Figures prepared in other formats such as Word, Excel or PowerPoint are acceptable but are generally discouraged. Failure to comply with these electronic submission procedures may result in processing delays. All cropping and manipulation must be completed before the images are submitted.

Figure files should be less than 10 MB in size in order to successfully convert for review through the ScholarOne Manuscripts submission system.

Please include all the figure captions, in list format, at the end of your manuscript text file. Please do not include a figure caption within its electronic file. Instead, please upload each figure caption during the electronic submission process so that it will appear under the corresponding figure when the .pdf copy of the manuscript is rendered.
Please name your figure files with the figure number as part of the file name.

Color. The submission of color images to Magn Reson Med is encouraged. Dark colors against a dark background do not reproduce well; please place your color images against a white background wherever possible. All color figures will be reproduced in full color in the online and print editions of Magn Reson Med at no cost to authors.

From the style guide: 
Illustrations
General
Illustrations should be as close as possible to the size desired when in print and saved in .tiff or .eps formats. They should not
exceed the desired size by more than twofold. In this manner, reduction of annotations beyond legibility can be avoided. The
sizing should be chosen so as to maintain constant information density.
Figures will be sized by column width when published to be a single column, 1.5 columns, or double columns. The corre-
sponding width measurements are:
Single column width: 20.5 picas; 3.42 in; 8.67 cm
1.5 columns width: 30.75 picas; 5.12 in; 13.02 cm
Double column width: 41.5 picas; 6.9 in; 17.56 cm
Page depth: 57 picas; 9.5 in; 24.13 cm
Line Graphs
Line graphs should have axis annotations with units given in square brackets or parentheses, e.g., R2[s-1] or R2(s-1). There
should be no titles in the graph, but rather, a title should be given in the figure legend, e.g., “Effective transverse relaxation
rate as a function of bone volume fraction in specimens of the human wrist”. Do not shade the graph’s background area.
Illustrations
All grayscale or color images should be provided in .tiff or .eps digital format. PDF images are permitted only for LaTeX
submissions. Manufacturers’ annotations and patient names must be removed and the images cropped to minimize areas
devoid of information. Either the RGB or CMYK color model is acceptable. The latter is optimized for use in paper print,
while the former may be preferred for on-screen viewing.
Spectra
1H and 13C proton spectra should be plotted with their chemical shift scales referred to the shift of tetramethylsilane
(TMS = 0). Increasing chemical shift values should indicate decreasing shielding. Spectra for other nuclei should be
referenced as recommended in NMR and the Periodic Table (eds: R.K. Harris and B.E. Mann) and/or other suitable
literature. Unless there is a compelling reason for them to be plotted otherwise, spectra should be black on a white background
with lines sufficiently thick to be clearly visible after reduction to journal size. Relevant signals should be annotated and the
pertinent acquisition and processing parameters provided in the legend.

Guidelines for the preparation of figures

We’ve created a checklist to help you when submitting figures for your article.

Although we encourage you to submit the highest quality figures possible, we consider a wide variety of formats, sizes, and resolutions, whether for submission and peer review, or after your article has been accepted. We’ve created a table that explains which formats are preferred.

It’s vital that you are aware of how to prepare and submit figures in line with high standards of ethical best practice. We’ve created guidance to help you.
Checklist for submitting figures

    Are all figures included in your submission as separate files or in a single PDF/Word document/LaTeX suite? Separate, original files in their original file format are best.
    Do all figures have an accompanying legend that describes the content and explains any abbreviations or symbols? Include your figure legends as a separate section in your main text file.
    Are all figures cited in the main text of your article? Ensure all figures are numbered in the order in which they appear.
    Are all words or symbols in your figures large enough for easy reading by your audience? Closely follow the preferred resolution guidelines for best presentation.
    Are all figures saved in an acceptable file type? Use the preferred file types for best image quality. If in doubt, submit a PDF for initial review.
    Is each individual figure file less than 10 MB? Remove any unnecessary white space around figures to reduce the file size.
    Were figures created at a size between 80mm and 180mm in width, and between 300dpi and 600dpi? Higher quality figures are more useful to readers and look better.
    Are all figure files named with their appropriate figure number? Use only the figure number in the file name.

Results Discxussion and conclusion 

In the “Results” section, significant findings and observations should be described. The section should not be a repetition
of the figure captions. In a separate section entitled “Discussion,” the results should be critically evaluated and interpreted
and placed in the context of existing literature. Further, authors should highlight whether the data are in agreement or at
variance with prior published findings. If a new method has been presented, its performance should be critically assessed
and compared with alternative methods. Speculation and extrapolation should be minimized or avoided altogether, and, if
presented, must be clearly identified as such and confined to the Discussion section.
In the last section, “Conclusions” (which may be merged with “Discussion” into “Discussion and Conclusions” provided no
speculation or extrapolation is presented) authors should state what can be concluded from the data presented. Please avoid
making excessive claims.

Short communication

Short communications are brief reports that focus on specific methodological developments of an experimental, computational or analytic nature. They should be concise, focussed on a specific technical issue and brief (the typical size of a short message is ~3000 words and 5 or fewer figures). Nonetheless, they should report an innovative technical development of broad significance to the medical physics community. Short communications should include empirical testing or validation of the core technique.

1 Introduction
The study of tibiofemoral kinematics, which describes the relative motion between the femur and tibia during knee joint movement, is crucial for understanding normal knee function and identifying pathological conditions [1]. Accurate assessment of these movement patterns can provide valuable insights into the diagnosis and treatment of various knee disorders, including osteoarthritis (OA) and ligament injuries [2,3, 4]. For instance, alterations in tibiofemoral kinematics have been associated with the progression of knee OA, one of the most common joint disorders affecting a significant portion of the global population [5].Additionally, studies have shown that the three-dimensional kinematics of anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knees are changed even during low-stress activities, such as walking. [6, 7] 
Dynamic MRI has proven to be a valuable tool for studying tibiofemoral kinematics in vivo, offering insights into both normal and pathological knee function under more realistic conditions. Recent advancements in dynamic MRI techniques have enabled researchers to capture knee motion with increasing temporal and spatial resolution. Real-time MRI is one approach that allows for rapid image acquisition during continuous joint movement, offering true real-time visualization of knee motion [8,9]. CINE MRI techniques, which reconstruct multiple motion phases into a single representative cycle, have been used to investigate patellar tracking patterns and tibiofemoral kinematics [10,11,12]. Cine phase contrast MRI directly encodes velocity information into the MRI signal, allowing for quantitative measurements of tissue motion [13,14]. 
Many of these dynamic MRI studies have incorporated specialized devices to guide knee motion and apply controlled loading conditions during imaging. These devices allow for the investigation of load-dependent variations in knee kinematics, providing insights into how the joint responds to different mechanical stresses [15]. Such approaches are particularly valuable for understanding the biomechanical changes associated with conditions like osteoarthritis and ligament injuries.


In these dynamic MRI studies of knee kinematics, researchers have employed various methods to extract kinematic parameters from the acquired data. Some studies use high-resolution static MRI scans to create detailed 3D models of the bones, which are then registered to lower-resolution dynamic MRI frames [8, 10]. This approach allows for tracking of bone movement throughout the motion cycle. Other studies utilize cine phase contrast MRI techniques, which directly encode velocity information into the MRI signal [14]. Kinematic parameters are then derived by integrating this velocity data over time. Additionally, some researchers opt for identifying and tracking specific anatomical landmarks in each frame of the dynamic sequence [9].
In light of these advancements in dynamic MRI techniques and loading devices, we recognized the need for an efficient method to analyze the resulting image data. To address this, we developed a semi-automated algorithm for segmenting the tibia and femur in 2D sagittal images of the knee during flexion-extension cycles. This segmentation serves as the basis for tracking specific kinematic parameters throughout the motion cycle. By employing this method in conjunction with a custom MRI-compatible knee loading device, we seek to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on in vivo knee mechanics. This combination of imaging technique, loading device, and analysis method offers a promising tool for both research and clinical applications in understanding normal and pathological knee function.
