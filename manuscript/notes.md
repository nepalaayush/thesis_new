- there are two journals where we send the manuscript: 

1. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine ( Cite Score: 6.7 Impact Factor: 3 )

Author Guide: 

- TTN: Please be sure to specify the manuscript type in your cover letter.

In order to be considered for publication, all submissions, regardless of manuscript type, must be carefully and concisely prepared. Magn Reson Med publishes the following manuscript types:

- Technical Notes are complete accounts of technical work of a limited scope but may also describe methodologically-orientated clinical studies of a limited scope or other such limited studies.

Technical Note 	2800 words 	5 figures plus tables 


Q. how many words per say? 
ans: 

- TTN: Corresponding author: Only one author may be listed as the corresponding author. The corresponding author need not be the first author. The Scholar One electronic manuscript submission process also allows the submitting author to be different from the designated corresponding author.

Magn Reson Med prefers authors to be listed without details of relative status but allows specifications of the contributions made by the co- authors in the Acknowledgement section of the manuscript. If the authors consider it essential and justified to indicate more prominently that two authors are equal in status, they may be identified with the caption ‘Author X and Author Y contributed equally to this work’ in the author’s footnote on the title page. If more than two co-authors are of equal status, however, this can only be indicated in the Acknowledgement section of the manuscript. Exceptional deviations from this require explicit permission of the Editor-in-Chief.

- TTN: Novelty: Any prior publication containing overlapping material by the author(s) must be cited in the references and should also be mentioned in the submission cover letter. In this case, novelty of the Magn Reson Med submission will be assessed based on its incremental novelty over and beyond the prior publication. 


- TTN: Formatting: Please use 
- 1.5 line spacing throughout on 
- 8 ½ by 11 inch or A4 format 
- with margins on all sides (how big are the margins?) 
- and in a basic font (e.g., Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Times New Roman) of at least 11 point throughout. 
- All pages should be numbered consecutively, including references, tables, and figure legends. Manuscripts that fail to conform to the organization requirements may require resubmission, with the consequent loss of the earlier submission date.

- Text. Please prepare your manuscript text using MS Word (preferred method)!, Rich Text format, or LaTeX. Please find an MRM LaTeX template available at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15222594/la_tex_class_file.

- PDF Manuscript Submissions. PDF submission for original submissions (not revisions, except for LaTeX submissions) is allowed, although not encouraged

- Word count only includes the body of the text (and appendices, when present) and not the title page, abstract, figure captions, tables, table captions, or references,  institution information, and key words.

Short communication

Short communications are brief reports that focus on specific methodological developments of an experimental, computational or analytic nature. They should be concise, focussed on a specific technical issue and brief (the typical size of a short message is ~3000 words and 5 or fewer figures). Nonetheless, they should report an innovative technical development of broad significance to the medical physics community. Short communications should include empirical testing or validation of the core technique.
