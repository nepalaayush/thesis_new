Author Guide: 

- TTN: Please be sure to specify the manuscript type in your cover letter.

In order to be considered for publication, all submissions, regardless of manuscript type, must be carefully and concisely prepared. Magn Reson Med publishes the following manuscript types:

- Technical Notes are complete accounts of technical work of a limited scope but may also describe methodologically-orientated clinical studies of a limited scope or other such limited studies.

Technical Note 	2800 words 	5 figures plus tables 


Q. how many words per say? 
ans: 

- TTN: Corresponding author: Only one author may be listed as the corresponding author. The corresponding author need not be the first author. The Scholar One electronic manuscript submission process also allows the submitting author to be different from the designated corresponding author.

Magn Reson Med prefers authors to be listed without details of relative status but allows specifications of the contributions made by the co- authors in the Acknowledgement section of the manuscript. If the authors consider it essential and justified to indicate more prominently that two authors are equal in status, they may be identified with the caption ‘Author X and Author Y contributed equally to this work’ in the author’s footnote on the title page. If more than two co-authors are of equal status, however, this can only be indicated in the Acknowledgement section of the manuscript. Exceptional deviations from this require explicit permission of the Editor-in-Chief.

- TTN: Novelty: Any prior publication containing overlapping material by the author(s) must be cited in the references and should also be mentioned in the submission cover letter. In this case, novelty of the Magn Reson Med submission will be assessed based on its incremental novelty over and beyond the prior publication. 


- TTN: Formatting: Please use 
- 1.5 line spacing throughout on 
- 8 ½ by 11 inch or A4 format 
- with margins on all sides (how big are the margins?) 
- and in a basic font (e.g., Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Times New Roman) of at least 11 point throughout. 
- All pages should be numbered consecutively, including references, tables, and figure legends. Manuscripts that fail to conform to the organization requirements may require resubmission, with the consequent loss of the earlier submission date.

- Text. Please prepare your manuscript text using MS Word (preferred method)!, Rich Text format, or LaTeX. Please find an MRM LaTeX template available at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15222594/la_tex_class_file.

- PDF Manuscript Submissions. PDF submission for original submissions (not revisions, except for LaTeX submissions) is allowed, although not encouraged

- Word count only includes the body of the text (and appendices, when present) and not the title page, abstract, figure captions, tables, table captions, or references,  institution information, and key words.

Everything to do with figures: 

from the author guidelines: 

Figures. Figures should be numbered in the sequence in which they are mentioned in the text. Figure callouts should be spelled out in the text (e.g., “Figure 1”). All figure sub-parts should be labeled A, B, C, etc. Symbols, letters, and numbers must be legible after reduction, at which time, the smallest data points should not be less than 1.5- to 1.7 mm high. Images need to be cropped and all irrelevant parts removed. Be sure to remove all patient or subject identifying information. Avoid the use of thin lines (1-point or thinner) and remove manufacturer’s annotation on images. Crop images to minimize the area devoid of information.

- To facilitate review, figures may be embedded within the manuscript text but must also be uploaded as individual image files. The authors’ placement of figures within the text will have no bearing on the final production layout, should the paper be accepted.

Figures should be submitted in formats based on image type. Please visit https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/Prepare/manuscript-preparation-guidelines.html/figure-preparation.html for more detailed information. Although native files are preferred, PDF image files are permitted. Figures prepared in other formats such as Word, Excel or PowerPoint are acceptable but are generally discouraged. Failure to comply with these electronic submission procedures may result in processing delays. All cropping and manipulation must be completed before the images are submitted.

Figure files should be less than 10 MB in size in order to successfully convert for review through the ScholarOne Manuscripts submission system.

Please include all the figure captions, in list format, at the end of your manuscript text file. Please do not include a figure caption within its electronic file. Instead, please upload each figure caption during the electronic submission process so that it will appear under the corresponding figure when the .pdf copy of the manuscript is rendered.
Please name your figure files with the figure number as part of the file name.

Color. The submission of color images to Magn Reson Med is encouraged. Dark colors against a dark background do not reproduce well; please place your color images against a white background wherever possible. All color figures will be reproduced in full color in the online and print editions of Magn Reson Med at no cost to authors.

From the style guide: 
Illustrations
General
Illustrations should be as close as possible to the size desired when in print and saved in .tiff or .eps formats. They should not
exceed the desired size by more than twofold. In this manner, reduction of annotations beyond legibility can be avoided. The
sizing should be chosen so as to maintain constant information density.
Figures will be sized by column width when published to be a single column, 1.5 columns, or double columns. The corre-
sponding width measurements are:
Single column width: 20.5 picas; 3.42 in; 8.67 cm
1.5 columns width: 30.75 picas; 5.12 in; 13.02 cm
Double column width: 41.5 picas; 6.9 in; 17.56 cm
Page depth: 57 picas; 9.5 in; 24.13 cm
Line Graphs
Line graphs should have axis annotations with units given in square brackets or parentheses, e.g., R2[s-1] or R2(s-1). There
should be no titles in the graph, but rather, a title should be given in the figure legend, e.g., “Effective transverse relaxation
rate as a function of bone volume fraction in specimens of the human wrist”. Do not shade the graph’s background area.
Illustrations
All grayscale or color images should be provided in .tiff or .eps digital format. PDF images are permitted only for LaTeX
submissions. Manufacturers’ annotations and patient names must be removed and the images cropped to minimize areas
devoid of information. Either the RGB or CMYK color model is acceptable. The latter is optimized for use in paper print,
while the former may be preferred for on-screen viewing.
Spectra
1H and 13C proton spectra should be plotted with their chemical shift scales referred to the shift of tetramethylsilane
(TMS = 0). Increasing chemical shift values should indicate decreasing shielding. Spectra for other nuclei should be
referenced as recommended in NMR and the Periodic Table (eds: R.K. Harris and B.E. Mann) and/or other suitable
literature. Unless there is a compelling reason for them to be plotted otherwise, spectra should be black on a white background
with lines sufficiently thick to be clearly visible after reduction to journal size. Relevant signals should be annotated and the
pertinent acquisition and processing parameters provided in the legend.

Guidelines for the preparation of figures

We’ve created a checklist to help you when submitting figures for your article.

Although we encourage you to submit the highest quality figures possible, we consider a wide variety of formats, sizes, and resolutions, whether for submission and peer review, or after your article has been accepted. We’ve created a table that explains which formats are preferred.

It’s vital that you are aware of how to prepare and submit figures in line with high standards of ethical best practice. We’ve created guidance to help you.
Checklist for submitting figures

    Are all figures included in your submission as separate files or in a single PDF/Word document/LaTeX suite? Separate, original files in their original file format are best.
    Do all figures have an accompanying legend that describes the content and explains any abbreviations or symbols? Include your figure legends as a separate section in your main text file.
    Are all figures cited in the main text of your article? Ensure all figures are numbered in the order in which they appear.
    Are all words or symbols in your figures large enough for easy reading by your audience? Closely follow the preferred resolution guidelines for best presentation.
    Are all figures saved in an acceptable file type? Use the preferred file types for best image quality. If in doubt, submit a PDF for initial review.
    Is each individual figure file less than 10 MB? Remove any unnecessary white space around figures to reduce the file size.
    Were figures created at a size between 80mm and 180mm in width, and between 300dpi and 600dpi? Higher quality figures are more useful to readers and look better.
    Are all figure files named with their appropriate figure number? Use only the figure number in the file name.


____ 


Results Discxussion and conclusion 

In the “Results” section, significant findings and observations should be described. The section should not be a repetition
of the figure captions. In a separate section entitled “Discussion,” the results should be critically evaluated and interpreted
and placed in the context of existing literature. Further, authors should highlight whether the data are in agreement or at
variance with prior published findings. If a new method has been presented, its performance should be critically assessed
and compared with alternative methods. Speculation and extrapolation should be minimized or avoided altogether, and, if
presented, must be clearly identified as such and confined to the Discussion section.
In the last section, “Conclusions” (which may be merged with “Discussion” into “Discussion and Conclusions” provided no
speculation or extrapolation is presented) authors should state what can be concluded from the data presented. Please avoid
making excessive claims.

Short communication

Short communications are brief reports that focus on specific methodological developments of an experimental, computational or analytic nature. They should be concise, focussed on a specific technical issue and brief (the typical size of a short message is ~3000 words and 5 or fewer figures). Nonetheless, they should report an innovative technical development of broad significance to the medical physics community. Short communications should include empirical testing or validation of the core technique.

For Magnetic Resonance Imaging journal: 

from  https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/magnetic-resonance-imaging/publish/guide-for-authors


TECHNICAL NOTES--shorter communications focusing on technical advances in the field.

- Lay out text in a single-column format.


Title page

You are required to include the following details in the title page information:

    Article title. Article titles should be concise and informative. Please avoid abbreviations and formulae, where possible, unless they are established and widely understood, e.g., DNA).

    Author names. Provide the given name(s) and family name(s) of each author. The order of authors should match the order in the submission system. Carefully check that all names are accurately spelled. If needed, you can add your name between parentheses in your own script after the English transliteration.

    Affiliations. Add affiliation addresses, referring to where the work was carried out, below the author names. Indicate affiliations using a lower-case superscript letter immediately after the author's name and in front of the corresponding address. Ensure that you provide the full postal address of each affiliation, including the country name and, if available, the email address of each author.

    Corresponding author. Clearly indicate who will handle correspondence for your article at all stages of the refereeing and publication process and also post-publication. This responsibility includes answering any future queries about your results, data, methodology and materials. It is important that the email address and contact details of your corresponding author are kept up to date during the submission and publication process.

    Present/permanent address. If an author has moved since the work described in your article was carried out, or the author was visiting during that time, a "present address" (or "permanent address") can be indicated by a footnote to the author's name. The address where the author carried out the work must be retained as their main affiliation address. Use superscript Arabic numerals for such footnotes.


    Figure captions

All images must have a caption. A caption should consist of a brief title (not displayed on the figure itself) and a description of the image. We advise you to keep the amount of text in any image to a minimum, though any symbols and abbreviations used should be explained.

Provide captions in a separate file.

Article structure
Article sections

    Divide your article into clearly defined and numbered sections. Number subsections 1.1 (then 1.1.1, 1.1.2, ...), then 1.2, etc.

    Use the numbering format when cross-referencing within your article. Do not just refer to "the text."

    You may give subsections a brief heading. Headings should appear on a separate line.

    Do not include the article abstract within section numbering.

Introduction

The introduction should clearly state the objectives of your work. We recommend that you provide an adequate background to your work but avoid writing a detailed literature overview or summary of your results.
Material and methods

The materials and methods section should provide sufficient details about your materials and methods to allow your work to be reproduced by an independent researcher. Some guidelines:

    If the method you used has already been published, provide a summary and reference the originally published method.

    If you are quoting directly from a previously published method, use quotation marks and cite the source.

    Describe any modifications that you have made to existing methods.

Results

Results should be clear and concise. We advise you to read the sections in this guide on supplying tables, artwork, supplementary material and sharing research data.
Discussion

The discussion section should explore the significance of your results but not repeat them. You may combine your results and discussion sections into one section, if appropriate. We recommend that you avoid the use of extensive citations and discussion of published literature in the discussion section.
Conclusion

The conclusion section should present the main conclusions of your study. You may have a stand-alone conclusions section or include your conclusions in a subsection of your discussion or results and discussion section.

<thinking>
To find a citation for cubic spline interpolation, I should look for a foundational or widely-used reference on the topic. A good starting point would be to search for academic papers or textbooks that discuss numerical methods or interpolation techniques.

For cubic spline interpolation, a commonly cited source is:

de Boor, C. (1978). A Practical Guide to Splines. Springer-Verlag.

This book is considered a classic text on spline functions and their applications, including cubic spline interpolation.

After addressing the citation, I'll need to address the other comments and questions raised in the context:

1. Clarify the Python version and whether a citation is needed
2. Explain whether the parameters for edge detection and labeling were constant across datasets
3. Clarify that the process wasn't done for each frame
4. Find a reference for the greedy nearest neighbor algorithm
5. Address the overall structure and clarity of the description
</thinking>

For the cubic spline interpolation, you can cite:

de Boor, C. (1978). A Practical Guide to Splines. Springer-Verlag.

Now, to address the other points:

1. Regarding Python version: You've already added the version (3.11.5). A general citation for Python isn't typically necessary in academic writing, but if you feel it's important, you could cite the official Python website (https://www.python.org).

2. For the edge detection and labeling parameters:
<thinking>
I should suggest adding a clarification about whether these parameters were constant across datasets or if they needed to be adjusted for each dataset. This information would be valuable for reproducibility and understanding the robustness of the method.
</thinking>

You should add a sentence clarifying whether the edge detection and labeling parameters were constant across all datasets or if they required adjustment for each dataset. For example:
"These parameters were optimized once for the given image contrast and resolution, and then applied consistently across all datasets."

3. To clarify that the process wasn't done for each frame:
<thinking>
I should suggest adding a clear statement at the beginning of the description to indicate that steps I and II were performed once for the entire image stack, not for each frame individually.
</thinking>

At the beginning of the description, add a sentence like:
"Steps I and II were performed once for the entire image stack, establishing consistent edge detection and labeling across all frames."

4. For the greedy nearest neighbor algorithm:
<thinking>
A commonly cited paper for nearest neighbor algorithms in computational geometry is:
</thinking>

You can cite:
Preparata, F. P., & Shamos, M. I. (1985). Computational Geometry: An Introduction. Springer-Verlag.

5. For overall structure and clarity:
<thinking>
The description could benefit from a brief introduction explaining the overall goal of the algorithm and how the steps work together to achieve bone tracking.
</thinking>

Consider adding an introductory sentence like:
"The semi-automatic bone tracking algorithm consists of four main steps: edge detection, edge labeling, reference point extraction, and transformation computation. These steps work together to identify and track the tibia and femur boundaries across all frames of the dynamic MRI sequence."

By addressing these points, you'll improve the clarity, reproducibility, and academic rigor of your methodology description.


________ 

I've provided a citation for cubic spline interpolation and addressed the other points in my previous response. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions about those suggestions.

<thinking>
Now, I'll focus on finding an alternative citation for cubic spline interpolation. While de Boor's book is a classic reference, a more recent and potentially more accessible source might be beneficial. I'll look for a widely-used textbook or review paper on numerical methods that covers cubic spline interpolation.
</thinking>

For cubic spline interpolation, you could also consider citing:

Press, W. H., Teukolsky, S. A., Vetterling, W. T., & Flannery, B. P. (2007). Numerical Recipes 3rd Edition: The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press.

This book is widely used in scientific computing and includes a comprehensive section on cubic spline interpolation. It's more recent than de Boor's book and may be more readily available to readers.

Now, to address the remaining points:

1. Python citation: As mentioned before, citing Python itself isn't typically necessary in academic writing. However, if you want to acknowledge the use of Python, you could include a footnote or mention in the methods section: "All analyses were performed using Python programming language (version 3.11.5, Python Software Foundation, https://www.python.org)."

2. Edge detection and labeling parameters: Add a sentence like: "The edge detection and labeling parameters were optimized once for the given image contrast and resolution, then applied consistently across all datasets, ensuring reproducibility of the method."

3. Clarifying the process wasn't done for each frame: At the beginning of the description, add: "Steps I and II were performed once for the entire image stack, establishing consistent edge detection and labeling across all frames."

4. Greedy nearest neighbor algorithm: You can cite:
Preparata, F. P., & Shamos, M. I. (1985). Computational Geometry: An Introduction. Springer-Verlag.

5. Overall structure: Consider adding an introductory sentence: "The semi-automatic bone tracking algorithm consists of four main steps: edge detection, edge labeling, reference point extraction, and transformation computation. These steps work together to identify and track the tibia and femur boundaries across all frames of the dynamic MRI sequence."

By incorporating these suggestions, you'll address all the points raised in the comments and improve the overall clarity and academic rigor of your methodology description.
