Dear Aayush,


Please find attached my revisions and comments for your consideration.


First of all, I want to congratulate you on the great work you did. I really enjoyed reading your manuscript, and it definitely sparked some thoughts and critical questions. I was very hands-on in editing (I hope this is OK), but overall I think the content is very good and just needs some further details here and there, and more discussion around what the main results mean (and how these matter to us). I would be happy to have a chat in the near future with you and Martin, specifically the results shown in Figs. 4 and 5 :)


Looking forward to the updated version.


Kind regards,

Nick
