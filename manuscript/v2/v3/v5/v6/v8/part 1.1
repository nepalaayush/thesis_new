Dear Aayush,


Thank you for the updated documents, and please accept my apologies for my slow response time.

Please find attached the revised documents with my comments and edits. Overall, I think it's getting there, but there is still some work to do.

One main thing I noticed is that a lot of the work we already put into improving the wording when writing the ISMRM abstract was not integrated here. So, I was a little annoyed having to seemingly make the same edits again. So, I essentially stopped editing after the Intro section - I'll ask you to implement/merge/integrate the already "improved" wording from the ISMRM abstract directly into the manuscript documents too (please cross-reference the wording in each document, and adjust as necessary). I have pointed out several instances of this in the Figure captions and the Intro.

Based on my current feedback, I think there are already enough edits for you to make. So, I'll gladly have a look at your next updated version (I hope that's OK).

Thanks and kind regards,
Nick
