Studying the relative motion (i.e., osteokinematics) between the femur and tibia during knee joint movement is essential not only for understanding normal knee function and diagnosing pathological conditions [1–3] but also for guiding therapeutic interventions [4], informing rehabilitation strategies [5,6], and improving the design and optimization of knee prostheses and other orthopedic implants [7–10].

Accurate assessment of tibiofemoral osteokinematics aids in diagnosing and treating various knee disorders involving altered joint biomechanics—such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries [11–13], meniscal tears [14], and osteoarthritis [15,16]—which may result from joint malalignment, increased laxity and instability, and compromised congruency of articulating surfaces [17].
