3. Further analysis revealed that the semi-automated method demonstrated improved precision with smaller standard deviations (SDs) in displacement measurements compared to the manual approach, with horizontal displacements of 1.7–2.7 mm vs. 2.2–3.3 mm and vertical displacements of 0.7–1.2 mm vs. 0.9–1.7 mm. 
the last line of the results subsection in the preamble. could we add with horizontal displacement SDs of yada yada and vertical displacemt SDs of yada yada..
