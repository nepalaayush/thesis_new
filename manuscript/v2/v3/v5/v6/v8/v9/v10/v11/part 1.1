Dear Aayush,


Thank you for your updated version and for addressing my comments!  I think the manuscript now reads really nicely. Attached are my edits and comments for your consideration. After addressing those edits/comments, I think you could go ahead and circulate to all co-authors :)


Keep up the great work,

Nick
