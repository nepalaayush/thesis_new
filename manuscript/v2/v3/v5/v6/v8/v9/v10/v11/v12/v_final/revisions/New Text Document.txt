Lachman = passive “manual-laxity” test

The Lachman test is performed with the knee flexed ~ 20-30 °. The examiner stabilises the distal femur with one hand and pulls the proximal tibia forward with the other; the patient stays relaxed. Any excessive anterior translation or a “soft” endpoint indicates ACL insufficiency. It is therefore passive (force comes from the examiner, not from the patient) and belongs to the same family as the classic anterior-drawer manoeuvre.

Your current protocol falls into this active category: subjects actively flex/extend against an axial load that your device supplies.
Implication for your reply

    The reviewer’s examples sit squarely in the passive manual-laxity group (drawer, Lachman).

    Your device, as configured, supplies only axial resistance during an active motion, so it cannot reproduce these passive AP-force tests without adding an anterior-posterior actuator or letting an examiner pull on the tibia inside the bore.

    The algorithm itself could still quantify the resulting translation once that external AP force is introduced.

Emphasising this active-vs-passive distinction—and listing a few other passive manual tests as shown above—makes clear why the present set-up cannot yet “measure drawer/Lachman,” while still underlining the algorithm’s potential if the hardware evolves.

# Knee Stability Tests and MRI Tracking Compatibility

Orthopedic knee stability tests can be effectively categorized by their biomechanical motion patterns, with **single-plane sagittal tests showing excellent compatibility for 2D MRI tracking** while complex multi-planar tests require 3D analysis. The Lachman test emerges as the optimal candidate for 2D sagittal plane MRI quantification, offering both clinical gold-standard reliability and ideal biomechanical characteristics for edge tracking methods.

Research demonstrates that anterior-posterior stability tests (Lachman, anterior drawer, posterior drawer) involve purely translational motion in the sagittal plane, making them theoretically compatible with 2D MRI tracking approaches. Current quantification methods achieve sub-millimeter precision with automated devices, and emerging MRI-based research shows comparable accuracy to traditional clinical assessment methods.

## Single-plane tests ideal for 2D tracking

The **Lachman test** represents the clinical gold standard for ACL assessment and demonstrates optimal characteristics for 2D sagittal MRI tracking. Performed at 20-30° knee flexion, the test involves pure anterior tibial translation under applied anterior force. The examiner stabilizes the distal femur while applying anterior translation force to the proximal tibia, producing **translational motion exclusively in the sagittal plane**. Normal knees exhibit firm end-feel with <3mm translation, while ACL-deficient knees show >5mm translation with soft end-feel. The test achieves 80-99% sensitivity and >95% specificity, making it the most reliable clinical assessment for ACL integrity.

The **anterior drawer test** shares similar biomechanical characteristics but is performed at 90° knee flexion. This positioning engages different secondary restraints, making it less sensitive (22-92% sensitivity) than the Lachman test. However, its pure sagittal plane translational motion makes it equally suitable for 2D MRI tracking. The **posterior drawer test** evaluates PCL integrity through posterior tibial translation, also involving purely sagittal plane motion with excellent specificity for PCL tears.

**Valgus and varus stress tests** at 30° knee flexion involve primarily angular displacement in the coronal plane. The valgus stress test assesses MCL integrity through medial joint opening, while the varus stress test evaluates LCL and posterolateral corner structures through lateral compartment gapping. These tests could theoretically be captured with coronal plane 2D imaging, though sagittal plane imaging would have limited utility for these assessments.

## Complex multi-planar tests requiring 3D analysis

The **pivot shift test** demonstrates the most complex motion pattern among knee stability tests, involving combined anterior translation, valgus angulation, and internal rotation across multiple planes. This test assesses anterolateral rotatory instability through a coupled subluxation-reduction phenomenon that cannot be adequately captured in a single 2D plane. The test's 4-5 degrees of freedom make it unsuitable for 2D tracking approaches, requiring comprehensive 3D motion analysis for proper quantification.

**Dial test (external rotation test)** primarily involves transverse plane motion, evaluating posterolateral corner integrity through external tibial rotation. Performed at both 30° and 90° knee flexion, the test measures rotational displacement with pathological thresholds >10-15° indicating posterolateral injury. The transverse plane motion pattern presents challenges for conventional 2D imaging approaches, though specialized axial plane tracking could potentially be developed.

## Current quantification methods achieve high precision

Advanced arthrometer devices have evolved from manual systems to sophisticated automated platforms. The **GNRB® (Genourob)** represents current state-of-the-art quantification, providing 0.1mm measurement precision with continuous force application from 0-250N. The device achieves ICC values of 0.72-0.83 for reliability, with threshold values of 3mm side-to-side difference detecting complete ACL tears at 70% sensitivity and 99% specificity.

The newer **DYNEELAX®** system combines anterior translation and rotational laxity measurement in a single device, offering 0.1mm precision for translation and 0.1° precision for rotation. This represents a significant advancement over historical devices like the KT-1000, which provided ±1mm precision but suffered from operator-dependent variability.

**Force application protocols** have become standardized, with most devices applying 67N, 89N, 134N, and manual maximum forces (typically 150-200N). Research demonstrates that **134N provides optimal balance between measurement reliability and patient comfort**, with normal anterior laxity averaging 3.63mm and pathological thresholds beginning at 3mm side-to-side difference.

## MRI-based research demonstrates clinical potential

Validation studies comparing MRI assessments to arthroscopic findings show **94-96% sensitivity for ACL tears**, comparable to the 94% sensitivity achieved by combined clinical tests. Real-time MRI capabilities now achieve temporal resolution of 1-1.4 frames/second with spatial accuracy within 2mm for velocities up to 217mm/s.

**Stress MRI protocols** successfully quantify joint opening under standardized mechanical loading. Valgus stress MRI uses 147N loading at 30° flexion to measure subchondral cortical distances, while various MRI-compatible loading devices generate physiologically relevant motion with up to 27 Nm knee moments.

**2D sagittal plane tracking studies** demonstrate excellent accuracy for patellofemoral and tibiofemoral kinematics. Spatial resolution of 1.6×1.6mm² is achievable with measurement accuracy of 0.8° variance for rotation and 3.6% variance for translation. **Anterior-posterior translation measurements achieve accuracy within 0.36-0.55mm for in-plane measurements**, validating the feasibility of 2D tracking approaches for sagittal plane stability tests.

## Technical implementation considerations

**Edge tracking algorithms** optimized for MRI contrast characteristics include gradient-based detection, multi-feature level sets, and temporal continuity enforcement. Automated segmentation using deep learning approaches (U-Net architectures) and active contour models provide robust motion tracking capabilities.

**MRI-compatible loading devices** use pneumatic systems to avoid electromagnetic interference, with standardized protocols ensuring reproducible stress application. Real-time SSFP sequences prove particularly robust for motion tracking, with balanced SSFP sequences optimized for dynamic imaging showing superior performance compared to conventional sequences.

The **optimal 2D imaging protocol** for knee stability assessment includes sagittal plane positioning parallel to ACL orientation, real-time SSFP sequences for motion robustness, standardized loading protocols, and automated motion tracking with validation markers.

## Research gaps and future directions

Current limitations include the need for **standardized protocols across different MRI platforms** and comprehensive validation studies comparing MRI-based tracking with established motion capture methods. Multi-center trials are needed to establish diagnostic thresholds and clinical utility for routine practice.

**AI-assisted analysis** represents a promising development, with machine learning approaches showing potential for automated abnormality detection and pattern recognition in laxity measurements. Integration of biomechanical data with real-time imaging could enhance clinical decision-making beyond current capabilities.

## Conclusion 

The research strongly supports the feasibility of 2D sagittal plane MRI tracking for specific knee stability tests, particularly the Lachman test and anterior drawer test. These tests involve purely translational motion in the sagittal plane with displacement magnitudes (5-15mm in pathological conditions) well within MRI detection capabilities. The combination of established clinical validity, suitable biomechanical characteristics, and proven MRI tracking technologies positions these tests as optimal candidates for 2D edge tracking quantification approaches.

While complex multi-planar tests like the pivot shift require 3D analysis, the high clinical value and technical feasibility of sagittal plane tests provide a strong foundation for developing MRI-based quantitative knee stability assessment systems. The technology exists to implement these approaches clinically, requiring primarily the development of standardized protocols and validation studies to establish diagnostic thresholds.
