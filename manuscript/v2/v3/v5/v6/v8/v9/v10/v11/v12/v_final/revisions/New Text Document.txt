Lachman = passive “manual-laxity” test

The Lachman test is performed with the knee flexed ~ 20-30 °. The examiner stabilises the distal femur with one hand and pulls the proximal tibia forward with the other; the patient stays relaxed. Any excessive anterior translation or a “soft” endpoint indicates ACL insufficiency. It is therefore passive (force comes from the examiner, not from the patient) and belongs to the same family as the classic anterior-drawer manoeuvre.

Other passive manual-laxity tests in the same family
Primary structure stressed	Typical knee position	Examiner-applied force / torque
Anterior drawer – ACL	90 ° flexion	Straight anterior pull on tibia
physio-pedia.com
Posterior drawer – PCL	90 ° flexion	Straight posterior push on tibia
physio-pedia.com
Slocum drawers – antero-lat / antero-med bundles	90 ° flexion, tibia internally / externally rotated	Anterior pull in rotated position
Lever (Lelli) sign – ACL	Supine, knee extended	Downward femoral push leverages tibia anteriorly
Pivot-shift / Jerk – ACL + anterolateral complex	Start full ext., apply valgus + internal-rot, flex to 30-40 °	Combined valgus & IR torque; tibia subluxes then reduces

Dial test – posterolateral corner (PLC)	30 ° and 90 ° flexion, prone or supine	External-rotation torque on the foot

Varus / Valgus stress – LCL or MCL	0 ° and 30 ° flexion	Lateral or medial bending moment
physio-pedia.com
Reverse pivot-shift – PLC	90 ° flexion to extension	External-rot + valgus torque causes posterolateral reduction
Posterior-sag sign – PCL	90 ° flexion	Gravity lets tibia sag posteriorly (still passive)
KT-1000 / -2000 (instrumented drawer)	20-30 ° flexion	Device applies graded AP force, reads displacement

All of these rely on an external force or torque while the patient’s musculature remains passive.
Active tests (patient generates the force) for comparison
Test	What the patient does	Main structure assessed
Active-quadriceps test	Isometric quad contraction from 90 ° flexion	PCL: quad pull reduces posterior sag
Step-down / single-leg squat kinematics	Functional eccentric loading	Dynamic valgus, patellofemoral tracking, etc.

Your current protocol falls into this active category: subjects actively flex/extend against an axial load that your device supplies.
Implication for your reply

    The reviewer’s examples sit squarely in the passive manual-laxity group (drawer, Lachman).

    Your device, as configured, supplies only axial resistance during an active motion, so it cannot reproduce these passive AP-force tests without adding an anterior-posterior actuator or letting an examiner pull on the tibia inside the bore.

    The algorithm itself could still quantify the resulting translation once that external AP force is introduced.

Emphasising this active-vs-passive distinction—and listing a few other passive manual tests as shown above—makes clear why the present set-up cannot yet “measure drawer/Lachman,” while still underlining the algorithm’s potential if the hardware evolves.
