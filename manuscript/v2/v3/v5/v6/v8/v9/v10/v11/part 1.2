<p>Thank you for your updated version and for addressing my comments!&nbsp; I think the manuscript now reads really nicely. Attached are my&nbsp;edits and comments for your consideration. After addressing those edits/comments, I&nbsp;think you could go ahead and circulate
 to all co-authors :)</p>

Respected Dr. Brisson,<br>
<br>
Thank you for your insightful comments. I have attempted to make&nbsp; <br>
changes accordingly, please have a look.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Aayush<br>

<br>
&gt; Dear Aayush,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Please find attached my comments and edits on your manuscript draft (v.9).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I really liked the adjustments you made to the Intro and Methods&nbsp; <br>
&gt; sections. Once you address my new comments, I think those two&nbsp; <br>
&gt; sections should be pretty much done :)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I didn't have the chance to look at the Result/Discussion section.&nbsp; <br>
&gt; Before I proceed, could you please make the requested changes to the&nbsp; <br>
&gt; Intro and Methods -- some details are missing about the actual&nbsp; <br>
&gt; research aims and outcome measures that I need to be able to&nbsp; <br>
&gt; properly appraise the Results/Discussion. In addition, as noted in&nbsp; <br>
&gt; one of my comments, please check whether the Journal guidelines&nbsp; <br>
&gt; allow to combine the Results and Discussion sections in Short&nbsp; <br>
&gt; Communications. I find this approach rather odd (but I know some&nbsp; <br>
&gt; journals allow it).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thanks and keep up the good work,<br>
&gt; Nick<br>
