Dear Aayush,


Happy New Year and all the best to you in 2025!


Thanks for the updated documents and for making the suggested changes :)


Please find attached my comments and edits on the title page, figures and captions. I'll try to get through the manuscript by the weekend.


Kind regards,

Nick
