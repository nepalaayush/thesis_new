<p>Dear Aayush,</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Thank you for the updated documents, and please accept my apologies for my slow response time.</span></p>
<div><br>
</div>
Please find attached the revised documents with my comments and edits. Overall, I think it's getting there, but there is still some work to do.&nbsp;
<div><br>
</div>
<div>One main thing I noticed is that a lot of the work we already put into improving the wording when writing the ISMRM abstract was not integrated here. So, I was a little annoyed having to seemingly make the same edits again. So, I essentially stopped editing
 after the Intro section - I'll ask you to implement/merge/integrate the already&nbsp;&quot;improved&quot; wording from the ISMRM abstract directly into the manuscript documents too (please cross-reference the wording in each document, and adjust as necessary). I have pointed
 out several instances of this in the Figure captions and the Intro.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Based on my current feedback, I think there are already enough edits for you to make. So, I'll gladly have a look at your next updated version (I hope that's OK).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Thanks and kind regards,</div>
<div>Nick</div>
