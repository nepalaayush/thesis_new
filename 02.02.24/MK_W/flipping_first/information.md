for this, the segmentation was really tough, because the first frame slice issue. the edge was pretty bad compared to the NW case, for some reason. and so, it is visibly off this segmentation and also ,the centroid for some reason is outside the pca, which apparantly can happen for non symmetric objects

- this is quite an important graph. this destroys the hypothesis that the unloaded should have higher distance than loaded due to compression. but as we can see, it is not the case. it is not even self consistent. 

- compare this , to separate segmentations :

here, one could be forgiven for thinking that there is indeed a significantly higher distance between the centroids, for the unloaded case.
